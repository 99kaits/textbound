Hey kid!  Do you wanna become a member? Yes No 
Don't be such a snob!

Who are you talking to?

Hello!

Come back after you finish EarthBound!

Don't be such a snob!

(There's no response.)



It was you!  YOU beat up my buddy, didn't you?
You'd better just beat it!

Yeah?



Uh huh... Uh huh...
You sound like a real whiner to me.
Don't get lippy, or I'll kick your butt!

You sure are strong!  You got me, at least...



Spit spit spit  Saliva spit spit  Do you want some gum?
Get yer own, twit.



To tell you the truth,
I like drinking tea and eating fresh vegetables, but that doesn't fit my super cool image.
I guess I just have to accept this about myself.



Frank has an incredibly powerful weapon.
If you get your hands on it, I bet you can stand against any enemy.

So you're a real Rambo-type guy?
I don't think so.



When you buy an item that should be equipped, do you bother to actually equip it?
Heh eh, I gave a hint to my own enemy...
I'm such a rockin' dude!
I obviously have total confidence in my own abilities.
So... are you ready to get it on, Spanky?


Buy Sell 

Hi, come in, come in!
What can I do for you today?

Hello there!  How may I help you?

Hello, may I take your order?  (smile, smile)

Hello. May I help you?

Hi!
Can I help you?

Hey mon!  
You got to expand your mind an' use this stuff creatively.
C'mon, buy some of my junk!

I like to sell my goodies on the street.
Sure, flies land on them, but in my opinion, it makes them taste even better!

Hello!  
Would you like some seasonings to add to your foods at meal time?
They are really quite miraculous!
Whenever you eat something, the seasonings will sprinkle automatically.
They come in these cute little packets and jars.

Would you like some bananas?

Sssshhh!  Don't talk too loud!
What do you want?

Oooga boooga.  (May I help you?)

You must have a long, tough road ahead of you, do you not?
No, there is no need to explain.  I already know... you must be hungry.
This is good timing for you.  I happen to be carrying something to eat.

Hi Hi Hi.  You come  buying?
You can sell,  too.
I, Mr. Saturn,  boing can do all  for you.
What do you  want zoom?

Out walking in the desert must make you very hungry and thirsty!

Hey dudes!  It's summer!  It's the manly time of year!  Time for sports, guys!
What can I do you for?

Hello there!
How would you like to buy some seasonings that go great on your food at meal time?
These are not just your average seasonings!
Whenever you try to eat something, the seasoning will automatically sprinkle on your food.  It's really almost magical!

C'mon in!  We've got the goods, G!

Hi!  Welcome to my store.
What do you need?

So, where's your mom and dad?
You mean you kids came in here all by yourselves...?
Well, I can make your order to go.

If ye be headin' to Scaraba, ye ought to shop here.
Things're expensive down there...
So, what're ye lookin' fer?

We've got some really spectacular things!

I can no longer make Magic Cakes...
But it doesn't matter because now I'm selling Magic Tarts, which taste even better than Magic Cakes!

We serve water, rice gruel and those sorts of things.

Welcome, welcome!  Ach, the heat!  Is your body okay?
Can I interest you in some of my merchandise?

Hissss, I'm Red Snake... come on in!
Kissss of Fire! Armpit hair fertilizer!  Yesssssss!

If you've already got what you need, great!
But if you don't, well, that would be a real shame.
Take a good look at my menu and decide.
Is there anything listed that you might want?

Hello there!  Welcome to my humble shop!
How about some of our famous Scaraba delicacies?

I sell water to those who are thirsty.

Since I'm dealing in some pretty rough stuff,
I can't run my business in town.

Let's play store.  My friend Ay-go loves this game.  So...
Hi!  May I help you?

Hi!  This shop specializes in puddings and pendants!
You'd like to buy some, wouldn't you?

Hi, how are you doing?  From the look of things,
I would say, not so good.
Yes No

Oh, my!
I just don't think you can carry any more than what you already have.
But you know, I might be able to buy some of the stuff you don't need.

I'm afraid you cannot carry anything else.
Do you want to sell some things that you don't need?

Ooops! You already have too much stuff.

You have so many belongings...  You just can't carry any more!

Oh, how are you planning to carry this?  You've got too much stuff!
Well, I guess I could buy the stuff you don't need.
Do you want to sell anything?

Well, you're straining with too many things now.
I'll buy the things you don't need, mon.

You are already carrying too much stuff.
You should sell some things, or throw them away, or just leave them somewhere.

You already have the maximum number of things you can carry.
You're going to have to sell some things, or just throw them away.
Then come again.

You cannot carry any more.

You aren't going to be able to carry any more stuff.
You're dragging around all that junk...
I guess I could help you out by buying some things that you don't need...

Whoa!  Woon woonga wakka woo!  (You are already carrying too many things.)

You're already carrying too much stuff.
Sell something, or just abandon something, and come again.

What a happy happy surprise.  Zoom...
You have  much  junk.

You're already carrying too much stuff.
Sell something, or just throw something away, and then come back to see me.

Dudes!  You simply have too much stuff in your kit!
But don't sweat it, I can buy some stuff you don't need.

Oh, I don't think you can carry any more.

Most unfortunately for you,  you're carrying too much stuff.

Hey!  You've already have got enough junk!
Do you want to sell me some of the junk you don't need?

You are already carrying too much stuff.
You can sell your stuff, throw something away, or just abandon it.
Then, come again.

You've got entirely too many goodies.
Would ye like me to take some of those things off yer hands?
I can buy the ones ye don't need, if ye want.

You are carrying too many things already.
Sell something, or throw something away, and come back.

You are carrying too many things.
Come again when you reduce the number of things you are carrying.

You're already carrying too many things.
Sell something, or throw something away, or just leave something somewhere, and come again.

Ahh, I can see that your caravan is overloaded.
Would you like to sell some of your extra items to me?

You are carrying too much ssssstuff
Ssssell it, or tossss it, and come again!

Oh... uh... it looks like you've got too many goods to carry.
Would you be willing to sell me some of the goods you don't need?

For heaven's sake!  You're already carrying too much stuff.
Sell something, or throw something away, and come again.

You cannot carry any more.

You guys are completely overloaded.
However, I can buy the stuff you don't need.
What do you want to do?

I really don't think you can carry any more purchases.
You can come again after you sell something, or you can simply discard an item to lighten your load.
Or, you might want to sell the things you don't need here!

You've got too much stuff already!
How about selling me some of the things you don't need?!

You're carrying too many things already.

Well, it looks like you don't have anything to sell to us.

I don't think you have any thing that you can sell.

Oh, so you don't really have anything to sell?

But look, you don't have any things to sell!

What are you trying to pull, anyway?
You say you want to sell, but you have nothing to offer?!
You've got some nerve, kid!

From my humble vantage point, it appears you have nothing to sell.

What gives?  You don't have anything to sell.

Are you trying to con me?  You've got nothing to sell!!

Though I  really would like to buy something from you, you have nothing to offer.

If you want to fully recover, there is a village full of... interesting people... just ahead.  Go there and take a good rest.
I have heard that the name of this village is Saturn Valley, but it cannot be found on any map.
I enjoy helping those who are in trouble.
...though I charge them for my trouble.

Oh,  you thank!

Thank you very much.

Hey buddy, thanks!  See you around!

Please come again.

Thanks a lot, bro!

Thank you!

Be careful not to drop or spill it.

Please come again.

Good-bye.

Ohh, thank  you very much.  May you never find rocks in your sandals.

Yesssss, you got ssssome good sssstuff!

If you do  decide that you need any of my goodies, you just hurry on back now,  y'hear?

Oh well, please find a way to come again.

The price  of things is determined by the relationship between supply and demand.
You kids are pretty sharp to be able to understand this theory so well!

See you later.

Hey, I know your hard-earned cash is important to you, but you should call your mom.

Anyway, be sure to pick up some items that would be helpful in the future, not just stuff you need right now.

If you are allowed to equip an item, and it is stronger than your current item, the window will flash.
If the item's power is equal to, or less than your current equipped item, the window looks normal.
If you can't equip an item, the window is black.

Hey!  L-L-Listen to what I've got to say!
When I took Picky to the place where the meteorite landed...
Oh!  Good evening ma'am.  You're looking lovely as usual.  *snicker*
Anyway, as I was saying, the police that were guarding the meteorite landing left suddenly to deal with the Sharks.  You know the Sharks, they're the local ruffians, and they were really going wild.  Suddenly, I noticed that Picky was gone.
I blame the cops... it certainly wasn't my fault at all.
When my dad gets back, I know I'm gonna get it...
You're my bestest friend.  Won't YOU help me find Picky? Yes  No 
If you refuse me, I'll say something that'll cut you like a knife.
Will you come with me? Yes  No 
Okay, okay... I won't say anything to hurt you.
Will you please come with me? Yes  No

Ah!  You're , right?
It's me, the tough business man!
You remember--from the Deep Darkness.
I never got the money back that you borrowed, but, lucky you, I bumped into your dad and he paid the debt for you.
I just wanted to let you know.
Gotta go now--busy, busy, busy!
Slam.  Beeeeep!

Hello, it's your dad.

Have you ever heard of a weird saying like this?
Just remember, I'm always behind you 100%.  Don't be afraid.
I know that you're brave.  You can do it!
Don't forget to call me periodically during your adventure.
I can make a record of your progress when you call me.
Oh yeah, I deposited $30 into your bank account.
Do you have your ATM card?
Withdraw your money from any cash machine and buy whatever you need.
Good Luck, m'boy!  I feel like such a hero!
What?  Well, the father of a hero, at least.  Wa ha ha!

If you buy something from me,
I'll give you a big discount, tee hee hee.



It seems like I'm always here...  I hope you don't mind!



I'm so much more relaxed here...
They never ask me 



Hello sir, how may I help you?  ...Uh...  Aren't you ?
After our battle I became serious, and have been working very hard.
I've even been doing some training for... for...
Well, a little bit of pro wrasslin'.  It's the ring for me, baby...
So you made it back alive.  You must have many stories to tell.
Let's get together for a drink, when you have a chance so I can hear your stories.
...I'm talking about drinking mineral water.  I'm still under age, you know.

Don't you think you get more food value out of 14 bucks worth of burgers than 8 bucks worth of french fries?
You'll feel better and more energetic if you eat better foods.
You know--you'll recover more health if you eat more expensive food.



I could give you a great hint for just $.
You'd like a hint, wouldn't you?
So you're telling me that you don't want a hint?
You're either awfully confident or $ is too much to pay.
Anyway, a young man like you is very unusual these days.
If you happen to need a hint, c'mon back!
I'm here all the time...

Well, I want to thank you for all the times that you used the hint shop.  It's been a while since I first saw you...
This is my final day in business.
..........
Well, so long kid,  No, no... Master .
See you again,  if fate allows it.

I have no more hints for you.
You've done such a good job to this point.
From here on out...
Trust your judgement, and also your luck.

Do you want to hear the hint once more?
This is a special service just for you...
There are lots of snakes and stray dogs around Onett.
Is the mayor going to let them just run around, doing whatever they want?
I'm here to protest!

Now wait a minute, youngster!
Yes No 

It seems that the citizens of Onett have been harassed by those dang street punks called the Sharks.
I wonder if going and talking to Frank, the leader of the Sharks, would do any good?

Oh, you don't have any money.  Don't you understand?
This is how I make my living... I can't just give you a hint for free, kid.

A very  special substance is necessary to complete the Phase Distorter.
You know, I wonder if the site in Onett where the meteorite landed has something to do with this?
I say, go there and check out the site.

Maybe ...  where you should visit is
Saturn Valley...

Do you know that talking rock in the Lost Underworld?

There is a very important place under the Tenda Village.

Oh, heeey!
Have you have you spoken with like, the Tenda deep in the cute, little Tenda village?
Oh... my... gosh...  Really???
Are you like, really serious???
I sound like a y'know, teenage girl?
Do you like the way I talk now?

To correct  shyness, you should let that person read a self-help book.
 is probably the best...  It was a best-seller, y'know.
If a whole group is shy, the leader of the group should read the book on shyness to all the group members, and the whole group may get over shyness.
Though at least a part will certainly stop being shy.
So, how many times did I use the word ?...

Well, usually you find books at the library.
One who goes to the the fishmonger and expects to find books is likely to get very embarrassed indeed.

It looks  like Apple Kid is trapped deep, deep, deep in the Stonehenge enemy base.

The Pencil Eraser makes pencil-shaped stuff disappear.
What do you think the Eraser Eraser machine does?

Apple...
Winters...
Andonuts...

It's tough,
 but you have to keep pressing on through the Deep Darkness.
That way, you'll find the village of the Tenda.
Don't give up yet.

If you need to brighten up a dark street you use...
Yep, that's right!  A flashlight!
Oh... you don't have one?  Actually, I knew that you didn't.
Well, what comes in handy is something that you, y'know, picked up in, y'know, the pyramid...
I forgot the name...  It's that whatchyamacallit... ohhh... crud!

There is a broken submarine in the Dungeon Man's tummy.
Once the submarine gets fixed, you can go to the Deep Darkness.
Uhhh... maybe...

I don't know if he's an enemy of yours or not, but the guy called  seems to be waiting for you.
Have you already met him before this?

Deep in the
 pyramid, there is an item called the , or so I've heard.
You shouldn't exit the pyramid unless you have  the .

After  you've made all the necessary preparations, go to the pyramid.
In front of the pyramid, as the writing on the hieroglyph told, step on the round stone plates in front of the sphinx, and draw a star.
That was really too much info to give out as a hint, wasn't it?

People say that there is a Magic cake vendor on the pavement by the beach in the resort of Summers.
Oh yeah,  means 
Well, I was just testing you...
Are you angry?  I didn't mean it... sorry!

After you get into the Stoic Club, be sure to talk to the man with the mustache at the back table.
This is a pretty important hint.

Try placing a call to  the Strip... ooops!  sorry,  I mean the Stoic Club.

You need to make a reservation by phone to go to the Stoic Club.
Someone in Toto, the port town next to Summers, should know the phone number.

Do you remember that Dr. Andonuts had the sky runner?
What do you say to your going and giving it a whirl?

In Winters, you've been to the cave north of Stonehenge, right?
I would bet it's one of 

It was a  while ago, but I heard that a silver flying contraption of some sort  crash landed in the graveyard in Threed.

I heard that you were asked to dinner by the cute maid at the Monotoli Building.
Lucky you!  I envy kids like you... but just a bit.

The maid out front of the Monotoli Building is waiting for the .

You should be able to find something out at the Monkey Cave in the Dusty Dunes Desert.
That's what I say... on to the desert!

The monkey...  got charred.
Is he all right?

Did you go back to Jackie's Cafe?
There seems to be something mighty suspicious behind the counter...

These days, young people seem to be so indifferent to what's happening in the real world.
It's disappointing that you seem to be indifferent about the real world, too.
For example, if you see someone lying in the street, don't you think that you should really stop and try to help him?

Have you been to Jackie's Cafe?
It's not difficult to find... the sign says 

Well...  I'm not exactly sure, but it seems to me that... the top floor of the department store is kind of suspicious...

The  department store in Fourside has reopened after being renovated.
People say that they have a good variety of things, but the prices are a little bit high.
Have you been there yet?

It's such a pity...
The Runaway Five have managed to get stuck at the Topolla Theater because of their debt problems.
Why don't you go and talk to Miss Fake, the manager of the theater?
That diamond you're carrying should come in handy.

So, have you been out taking any walks lately?
Walking is great.
You know, it's not good for you to always be riding the bus 'cause it's way too easy.
Walk down the road between Dusty Dunes Desert and Fourside.
Especially be sure to walk across the bridge.
There's nothing quite as exciting as walking across a bridge when you don't know the train schedule...

Have you  told the treasure hunter in the desert that you beat five bosses?
I used to be a businessman, and I can tell you from experience.
Reporting is crucial.

The Runaway Five, who are now appearing at the Topolla Theater, got stuck again because of financial problems.
To help them, a tremendous amount of money will be needed.
Hey, talking about a tremendous amount of money, do you know about the Dusty Dunes Desert?
You should head to the desert to look for buried treasure.
It would be fabulous if you found it!

If you  happen to get weak, you should just go to sleep.  This is basic.
That way, you can recover your strength.

At the 
Topolla Theater, the Runaway Five have booked a series of gigs.
This is just a rumor, but I hear that they've been snowed again and are in some kind of trouble.
So...  If I were you, I'd go and talk with them.

In the  middle of Dusty Dunes Desert, there is someone who's starving.
...I just sense it.

Oh, you've forgotten to get something really important.
Be sure to check the garbage can that is left behind by the Boogey Tent.

Mr. Saturn  must have told you to wait for three minutes in front of the waterfall.
What?  You don't know where the waterfall is?
The waterfall is actually named Grapefruit Falls.
After you exit the tunnel that begins in the Threed graveyard, go to the north.
You certainly know about the cave to Saturn Valley that is then on your right.
But...  You should not go in that cave.
Keep going straight north.
You'll eventually come to the Grapefruit Falls.
Then, wait patiently for three minutes.

It seems like you don't know what to do in Saturn Valley.
The Mr. Saturn on the second floor of the cave should be able to tell you a password to get you into the secret base.
Now that sounds like some handy info!

"Saturn Valley is very nice!  You should go  at least once or twice"

There's an underground path northwest of this town.
Those guard zombies should be gone now.



What, didn't you read the Zombie paper instructions?

Do you know about that mysterious tent that appeared at the south end of town?
I don't know, but...  it looks kinda...  strange...

So, how are you doin', kid?
If you're tired, you should go to the hotel and rest.

There's a tunnel northwest of this town.
There are two guard zombies that hang out at the entrance.
They are actually pretty nice guys...
It might be a good idea to meet those guys...
But it's quite all right if you don't...
Though I think that you really ought to go there.

I don't think there is anything else you need to do in this town.
It's okay of you stay, but it's really okay if you leave...

The Runaway
 Five, the band at the Chaos theater, is up to their eyes in debt.
Could anyone pay off their debt for them?

Go and see Everdred, the boss of Burglin Park.
Just trust me... you go see him.

's father at the Polestar Preschool must be really worried.
You should be considerate of a father's feelings toward his daughter.
He's only human, y'know!

You know that  is in the mountain cabin, right?
By rescuing her, you actually rescue yourself.

This is my business, so I'm happy to have customers.
But, don't you know this is a crisis?  You shouldn't be wasting time here.
Anyway, I'll keep your $.

Do you remember seeing a litte mountain cabin on the way through the Peaceful Rest Valley?
There must be a cave in the Happy Happy village that leads to that cabin.

Have you been to the Happy Happyism headquarters at the center of Happy Happy village?
Do you want to go there?
Or not?
What?
Why can't you make up your mind!

Have you spoken to Everdred in Burglin Park?
Well, well, well...  That's not good.
You really should take the time out to meet Everdred.

You got a call from Apple Kid on your Receiver phone?
What are you doing here, so far away from his home?
I can't give you any hints, but I'll keep your $.

If you go east from the bus stop, you will enter the Peaceful Rest Valley.
If you keep going east, you will come to Happy Happy Village.
You should maybe go there, unless you have something better to do?

Have you been to Apple Kid and Orange Kid's houses?
Their places are south of the Polestar Preschool.
They are great inventors ...to be.
They need some financial help.
If you help them ...later, for sure, without fail, certainly, something wonderful will happen.
Believe me, this hint is worth a lot more than you paid.

Have you heard of a girl named ?
She lives in Twoson, the town next to Onett...
They say she has some pretty spectacular supernatural powers.
You can get to Twoson by heading south.

The police  were here looking for you.  Did you do something illegal?
Head south on the street in front of my shop.  You'll find the Onett Police Station.
I think it's best if you turn yourself in... no matter what you may have done.

You're on your way to Giant Step, aren't you?
Just be careful, the police are pretty touchy about people, not to mention kids, going up there...

Go northwest.
A traveling entertainer is having some trouble getting into a locked shack...

So, have you met B. H. Pirkle, the mayor of Onett?
Mayor Pirkle's office is on the second floor of Onett City Hall.

That's it for today.
 my dear.

At the Dinosaur Museum in Fourside...
A man called called Mr. Spoon has a heavy mustache...

Did you go  to the second floor of the Scaraba Cultural Museum in Summers?
If you are lucky... you'll get to see the hieroglyph.
...Yeah, you sure would be lucky.

How about this for some extra special help--I'll teach you some great tactics for dealing with Belch.
Belch really loves Fly Honey, from what I've heard.
Therefore, you should use the Fly Honey during battle.

What?  You DID talk to him?  So, why are you here?
Go back to the Peaceful Rest Valley.

Well, well, well...  That's not good.
You really should take the time out to meet Everdred.

If you have the Carrot Key,  you should go to Dalaam and give it to the bunny at Pink Cloud.
If you don't have the Carrot Key, you should go to Magnet Hill.
You should be able to find the Carrot Key there.

Heck, since the door to the sewer is open, why not go all the way inside and look around?
I know the stink and the vermin could overpower you, but it might make you tougher, too.

An autograph with a banana!  I mean,  A banana with an autograph!
You'd better get this to Mr. Spoon right away!

If you want
 to meet Venus, you should go backstage at the Topolla Theater.





I want to tell you the story of the creature from the vegetable soup, but I won't because I don't want to bother you with a story that has nothing to do with your adventure.
If I keep talking about unrelated stuff, you might start ignoring important messages.
It's important for you to talk to people.
Also, a person might give you a different message, depending on when you speak to them.

Isn't it nice to talk to so many people?

Yes!  Keep  the lines of communication open.  Just like you are doing now.

Thank you for taking the time to talk to me again.
Ah!  So you see what I mean!  It's important to take time out to talk with many people.

I gave you some advice when I spoke to you the first time, right?



I like cottage cheese on bread!
You haven't tried it?  It's the latest craze in culinary circles!



It seems like every bakery has been making lucky sandwiches these days.
They're kind of like fortune cookies, except you can win stuff.
Oh yeah, and it's a sandwich.
Okay, so maybe it's not like a fortune cookie.
Anyway, the best thing that can happen is 
I just wish I knew what  was...



I'm really sorry that my kids troubled you so much...
Both of you are really going to get it now!
By the way, I would be happy if you left sometime soon.
I'm tired of your family living next door.
We've loaned your father a lot of money.
It may have been a hundred thousand dollars or more...
Well, I guess it really could have been less, but because of the loan, my family and I now live in poverty!
My husband is much too lenient with the children.
Oh well, nice guys finish last.  That's the story of our life...
Ayaaaeee!
I think it's a dung beetle!  I'll smash your guts out!

*Sigh* ...I'm so tired... nag, nag, nag...



My husband is very soft-hearted.

As usual, you're wearing your grubbies!  So, what do you want?
My son isn't at home now.  He's walking around somewhere.
My husband is also gone.  Oh yes, this is Mr. Prettyman.
He always has great advice.  He's a real gentleman, he is.
You'll be happy that you met him.

Where in sam hill have you boys been?
I'll have to think of a suitable punishment!



Agh! *Gasp*  I was...
...much weaker than I thought...
So you must now begin your adventure... see... you...
Oh, I just remembered...
Listen to my final words...
To defeat Giygas, your own power must unite with the Earth's... the Earth will then channel your power and multiply it...
There are eight points that you must visit.  Make these places your own...
Each of these locations is 
One of them is near Onett.  It is called 
Go there first...
Do you understand? Yes  No 
...I see.
I apologize.  I guess I didn't explain it well enough...
All right.
You are a very intelligent young man... and...
Oh!  The pain!... Everything is getting dark... urgh!... *Gasp*...
Before I pass on, I want to give you something...
It is the Sound Stone.
You can record the melodies from the eight  locations into this stone.  It is an awesome item...
By the way... I'm almost gone, but did you want to hear the story one more time? Yes  No 
Good!
It's already dawn outside...
But it doesn't matter to me.  I'm fading fast...
Argh! *Gasp*

Oh, okay...
What the...?
It seems that you have too many things to carry already...
Since you can't take it, I'll give it to your sister.
In the blink of an eye, like magic, she'll have it.
Eeeyah!

Oh, hi.
Pokey, my brother, ran out of here to chase after a police car.
He said   So I'm home watching our house.
Mom and Dad aren't home yet.  They went out to an elegant restaurant.

I'm so sleepy...
Mom and Dad haven't gotten back from town yet.
Pokey ran out, and he hasn't returned.  I'm thinking about going to bed.

Salutations!  You're the boy living next door.
I heard that your family is in debt.  Ms. Minch told me about it.
Well, live and learn.  You just have to keep plugging away.



My dad really got after me.
He said I get no dessert for the rest of the decade...



I don't wanna look at the meteorite anymore.

I haven't seen you in a while.  You look cool.
I'm nowhere near as cool as you.  I'm just average cool.



Welcome to Hotel Onett.

A one night stay will cost you $.
Would you like to stay?

See you next time.

Good morning.  Did you sleep well?

Have a nice stay.

It looks like you don't have  $...



Our nightly rate is not cheap, but we have clean sheets, and the rooms are secure.
I'm sure you understand that this keeps us very busy.



You look like you'd be a real target for the Sharks.
You'd better be careful.



Can you believe it?
A group of ruffians spit their gum on me as I was passing by...

















Yes... the Onett Times... Uhhh...
Well,  I made a mistake and brought you a newspaper called OnettStar on accident.
Let me read you the headline anyway...

Well, that's OnettStar for you.


Someday, we'll see you there...&gt;






The world's largest department store, the Fourside Grand&gt;



...Oh, there's no issue today... sorry.

&lt; found to be major source of nutrition and energy&gt;

  Historical sites!
Come to the glorious jewel named Scaraba!
Scaraba Tourist Association&gt;






Hotel Onett in lovely downtown Onett.&gt;
...Hey, this is our ad!




Many book borrowers giving library books away or never returning them&gt;







Good morning!  Here's your free copy of the morning newspaper!

Here's today's headlines in the Onett Times...

There's an  advertisement in today's Onett Times that looks interesting.



Do you actually think you can just come up and talk to me anytime you want?



I've seen you around a lot lately.  He he he.



The townspeople are in a state of confusion.
At times like this, riots break out, or people start acting wild, so we police are being ultra cautious.

So you've traveled all over the world.
I bet you didn't meet anyone stronger than I, did you?
I know that you didn't...  Wa ha ha ha!

I've been playing  lately...  I'm having a tough time.

Why is the road to Twoson closed?  An emergency, of course.
At times like this, kids like you should be playing Nintendo games.
Anyway, are you sure you want to go to Twoson? Yes  No 
Well then, perhaps you should just crawl back to your shack, little mister.

Okay, *chortle*  Follow me.

Well then,  perhaps you should just crawl back to your shack, little mister.

Show me what you got...
See if you can get past five of my best men...
Eeeeyah!
Hey, small fry!
  You must be shaking in your boots!
You're tough.  You should join the  police force!
Your average policeman is stronger than any super  hero!
Oh... you won...
Don't let the Mayor's compliments give you a big  head...
Bring it on, fat boy!
Let's do this again sometime...
Next time, I'll take you out with my nuclear suplex attack!
C'mon!  I'm going to take you apart right here, right now, baby!
Grrr...  I lost...
That's it, buddy...
You can forget about me, I'm going to call for my boss!
There is no way I can beat you in a straight competition, so... get ready for my 
I didn't think you would do so well against the mighty Onett police force...
You want me to open the road to Twoson?
Hang on for a sec, I'll radio my staff and give them the word...
*Beep, beep* ...*Click*... *Rrrr*
*Click*  Strong here... do you read me?
...*Krrrr* ...Hey!...
...It's me, Captain Strong!...
Okay, listen, a kid named  will be there in a few minutes...
He's a kid in a red cap... I want you to open the road to Twoson for him...
I know that...
I know that!...
Don't ask me why, just do it!  That's an order! ...Strong out...
Well kid, I'm not going to question you now, but I do want to see you again...
Good luck!



I would rather be working as a parking meter cop...
It's just been too busy lately.  I'm sick of it.

Well, the riot's over.  Now I can move on to parking enforcement!
Hooray!  Life is good.  Dum dee dee dee...



Man, am I steamed...  Don't even try talking to me.

Why are you asking about a driver's license?
You're way too young to even think about getting behind the wheel, you little pest.



So here you are.
You're the little delinquent that came back from Giant Step!
Now you listen here...
 means just that-- DO NOT ENTER!  You got that?
And furthermore...
Blah blah
Blah blah
It's usually those tax evaders who...
Blah blah
Blah blah
We don't enjoy blocking off the roads, you know...
Blah blah
Blah blah
It's usually the local whiners that make a big deal about emergencies and meteorites!

Let's go, go og!  Oops!  My mistake, go!
'scuse me!  Uuuuuh... yeah.



There are lots of snakes and stray dogs around Onett.
Is the mayor going to let them just run around, doing whatever they want?
I'm here to protest!



I work for City Hall, but somehow Mayor Pirkle bugs me.
Let's keep this between you and me.



We don't have any openings for part-time employees at this time.



Did I tell you that I saw a Giant Ant one time at Giant Step?
...
Oh, sorry.  I did ant mean to spoil it for you.



Some suspicious-looking kids are hanging out in the woods north of the library.
I wonder if they are members of the Sharks.
To stop the spread of the gang, someone should shut down their gathering places, don't you think?
I've started a movement that will stop all of the bad influences on the children of Onett.
I call it the   Hum de dum dum...



I'm really in a foul mood.
Why?  Because the Mayor doesn't like me.
I think I'll just kick back for a while.
It just may take me a couple of hours to sign this paper. *snicker* *snort*



Oh, aren't you ?
Is it a school holiday today?  Have you done your homework?
Remember to brush your teeth before going to bed.
Have you been wetting your bed?



The Mayor's office is on the second floor.
You need an appointment before you visit.
I'm going to have to stop you if you try to see the Mayor.

Look.  I told you so...

Since you beat up the Sharks, you're the talk of the town.
Mayor Pirkle is waiting for you.

You look like someone who's going to do something big.

What was I thinking-- you did something really big!



Hey hey hey!  I'm Mayor B.H. Pirkle.  It's so nice to meet you.
You beat up the town bullies, punched them out big time, kicked their butts, bit their heads off, spit in their eyes, and made them wet their pants.
Then you forced them to promise not to make any more trouble.  Thank you!
What?  You want a key to the touring entertainers' shack?
For someone as great as you, giving you the key could help keep the town peaceful.
However, if you encounter a dangerous situation, please don't ask me to take any responsibility.
I'll be able to avoid any responsibility, right? Yes No 
I'm a very important man in these parts.
Do you think I'm important? Yes No 
Look, I'm the big cheese around here, and a brat like you should realize when someone is trying to be nice.

Oh, 
I saw a picture in the international newspaper of someone who looks like you, but there's no way it was you.
Maybe you'd like to study my city management techniques so that you could become Mayor someday?  Wa ha ha!
Since I returned peace to the town of Onett I was re-elected Mayor.
Are you here to celebrate?  YES   NO 
Don't be so shy!  A child shouldn't be so self conscious.

Hey, what's-your-name!
I'm so busy with my election that I don't have time to meet with you.

You're such a smart kid...  Here's the key to the shack.

I'm a very important man in these parts.
Do you think I'm important? Yes No 
Look, I'm the big cheese around here, and a brat like you should realize when someone is trying to be nice.

Look, I'm the big cheese around here, and a brat like you should realize when someone is trying to be nice.

Thanks a lot.
From this day forward... until the day I die... *sniff*
I will dedicate my life *sniff* to peace in Onett... *boo hoo*

Don't be so shy!  A child shouldn't be so self conscious.

Although it's small, the key is very important.
You seem to have too much to carry.
Get rid of some stuff you don't need, and come back for the key later on.



In the next election, please give a speech supporting Mayor Pirkle.
Hee hee hee.

Since way, way back, you and I have been very tight.
Pals basically.  Ya ha ha ha ha.



Thank you so much for all of your help...



City Hall is to the east.  You know,  where the sun rises!



I moved here from the way, way, way away next town.
In the next town, there is the... what is the name?... uh... Polar Star preschool.
The preschool is at 's house.
 uses... what is it called?... uh... magic.

When you're in trouble, do you think you'd ever like to have a hint? Yes No 
All righty then, you're on your own.  Good luck!

Why don't you get a hint from the next house?

All righty then, you're on your own.  Good luck!



Mr. Lier X. Agerate, the treasure hunter, finally found something interesting.
I heard he will only show it to you.

The hotel is located to the west.
I'm sad 'cause I only got this short message.



I wonder if  has been released yet.

Listen to this!  I finished EarthBound!



(Please take my son along.
He may look like a regular, small mouse, but he can lead you to an exit if you're lost in a maze.)
(Will you take one of my sons along?)Yes  No 
(You understand that you don't need any money for this...)

(Oh, you have him already.)

(He's a tough boy.  You can treat him as one of your items.)

(You understand that you don't need any money for this...)

(Didn't you leave my son with someone?)

(You have too many items.  You can't take my son.)



(Trust me on the dark road.)



(Oooo.  Do I get to come along too?)



I live rent-free in the mouse's house.
The mice are known as 
They are very kind, and boy are they fast!
I really love these guys!



Hi!
Kids can borrow only maps at this library.
Do you want to borrow one? Yes No 
A man without a map isn't popular with the girls.
Do you want one now? Yes No 
Here's a map.
Onett isn't the only thing on the map.
All the info is there, except for the info that isn't there.
Pressing the X Button allows you to view the map at any time.  How convenient!
You know, the X Button... located near the top.  Ha ha ha.

It's not necessary to return the map now.
Come back in the year 2001 to return it.

Please return our book  later!

All the info is there, except for the info that isn't there.
Pressing the X Button allows you to view the map at any time.  How convenient!
You know, the X Button... located near the top.  Ha ha ha.

I suggest  you bring a map along, even if you have to give up something else.
You seem to be carrying many worthless items.



That book's great!  Study it hard.

You can't use  the .

...Finally,
 you've come to return the book.  Seems like you finished it.
You're such a good boy.  As a reward, I'll give you a kiss.  Smack!



At  there's a monster guarding that spot from the outside world.
No one knows when the monster made Giant Step its territory.
I wonder if he's stronger than my wife...



.....       .....            .....
(A man of few words.  It's useless talking to him now.)

Oh, hi .
It's another nice day.  What?  You'd like the book ?
I've read it.  It's a great book.  So you want to overcome shyness also?
You should be able to find it on the bookcase.

Hi!  Nice to meetchya!
I'd really love to sit down and chat with you someday.
I'll talk about my adventure, and you can tell me about all of your mistakes.

Are you a friend of ?

I read the book called 
It said that these days, there are always telephones in hotels and drugstores.
I also learned that to use a green pay phone costs a dollar, while the black phones are free.
If you weren't aware of this, all your money could get eaten up by your phone calls.
I'm glad I read that book...



Recently, I sensed the presence of UFO's flying around... or am I just dreaming?

These days have been peaceful.
I miss the UFO's and monsters, 'cause they haven't been around recently.



I recently read a book titled 
It said that our modern society demands that there always be an ATM in hotels and drugstores.
Just knowing that is convenient!
I'm glad I read the book...
I can't believe I didn't know this stuff.
I'll check whether or not we have an ATM in our drugstore...



.....

Shhh!  You're bothering people!

The truth is, I like to talk!
Since I'm in a library, I'm trying to be quiet.  Oh man!



.....

Quiet!


Shh!  Shh!
You're too loud!  Try to move around quietly, Mr. Noisy pants.



I'm cramming for the big test tomorrow.
It's about games.
 ...if you stay at a hotel, you'll wake up with full HP and PP.

...recovering your life will give you full HP, but zero PP.
...Hmmm... I bet this stuff will be on the test...



I'm researching 
It's located north and west of Onett.
I heard it possesses a special power!

Clap, clap, clap.
When I see you, I get the urge to give you a hand.



I can't believe I saw it with my own eyes.
I was staring out the window and there it was, just fluttering there...
I'd only seen it in the encyclopedia before.
What was it?
A Magic butterfly!
If you get close to a Magic butterfly, all your cares fly away, just like a fluttering butterfly.
Yep, yep!
That's the effect of the legendary Magic butterfly.
I love talking about it!
Ooops!
Sorry about the outburst...
I got carried away with all the talk about lovely butterflies...



Who do you want to see?

Please pay $ for the doctor's fee.Yes No 
Your friend, right?...  It's very serious.

I'm not busy right now.
Shall I explain about the hospital system?
Yeah, well, I am actually pretty busy.

If you are the patient, come into the back room.

We don't have a person like that in our hospital.

I'm so glad that you recovered, .

Besides being unconscious, whenever you don't feel so well, come and talk to a doctor.
Everything I just told you applies to hospitals all over the world.

Yeah, well, I am actually pretty busy.

You need to be examined?  Then, you need to see the doctor... not me.

You don't have enough money.  Go home, and then come again.

I heard that around here, our doctor is No. 1.  Hee hee hee...



Welcome to Onett Hospital.  I run the place.
Ah... gotcha!!  Sorry.  I'm just a patient here.

Ah... gotcha!!  Sorry.  I'm just a patient here.

Have I told you this joke already?  Oh, sorry...



I was SMAAAAASHED by a mouse.

My SMAAAAASH wound will soon heal.



What?  You're here to visit my daughter?
So you're the one who calls her in the middle of the night and talks for hours!
...oh, it's not you.  Then why did you come to this room?

What?  You're here to visit my daughter?
So you're the one who calls her in the middle of the night and talks for hours!
...oh, it's not you.  Then why did you come to this room?

It's you again.



When I came to visit my friend at this hospital,
I somehow slipped and fell in the hallway.
So now I'm staying in the hospital too.
This could be the basis for a great, tragic tearjerker.  Well, maybe not...!



I'm doing this because I trust you.
First, let's go to the basement.
Ah!  I can tell by the look on your face you don't want to hang out, do you?
That's all right.  After all, we are not even related.
I know you think I'm a big liar but maybe I'll surprise you!

You're being vain, .
Life is...  Not that easy.
You just saved the Earth from a crisis...  Don't act so stuck up.
...When I was younger I too saved the Earth many times.
I live a modest life.  That's the way it should be.
Don't you think a real hero is someone like me? Yes No 
,
Don't be such a snob!

Someone like you should just hang around that dreamer Gerardo Montague.

When you  grow up, why don't you become my partner and we'll make lots of money.

,
Don't be such a snob!

You might think me a fool but when I do a job, I do it well.
I'm a man's man.  I'll be a big hero.
Ignore me for now if you want...



You've grown since I last saw you.  You're beginning to look like a man.
You're so cool!
I... I think I really like you.
Well, you know what I mean.

Hi, !  It's starting to get crowded in this hide out.
I was considering moving to Beak's Point.
What do you think? Yes No 
You're right.  This space might be just the right size for us.

You know what I mean.

Aren't you 's new friend?
How could I tell?  It's just a feeling!
You might have the feeling that  is around.

Do you really agree?  Let's build a strong, sturdy shack.

You're right.  This space might be just the right size for us.



I had a dream about you, and you were traveling with a cute girl.
If the dream comes true, say hi to her for me.
After all, I'm single...

You... seem to be gaining self confidence or something...
During your trip, were you popular everywhere you went?
...I'm jealous.  I wish I was popular like you...

Love!

How did you find this hide out?
 must have told you about it.

I maybe  wrong, but I feel like you're being accompanied by a cute girl.



I'll give you my ,
I know you've wanted it for a long time.
It's the best cap for someone really brave like you.

, I've been thinking about our gang's name.
It's 
Do you like it? Yes No 
...Okay.  Laugh doesn't really mean 
It means 

I'll give you my ,
I know  wanted it for a long time.
Putting this cap on will make you stronger.  Yep, yep, yep!
Are you 's friend?
Did he ever talk about me? Yes No 
Maybe he didn't talk much about his friends.

I'd like to
 go on an adventure with you once I become a little stronger.

Ah!  You can't carry anything else.
You should either sell or throw away some junk and come back.

My philosophy is !
Really? You like it?  I knew you would understand.

...Okay.  Laugh doesn't really mean

Oh!  That's the  I know...!

Wha-!
Oh!
You woke me up...
Pokey!  I've been looking all over for you...
You see, Pokey got scared and ran away...
Well, I'm glad that you're okay at least...
Let's go home now.  I bet Mom and Dad are worried sick about us.
Geez!  Sometimes I wonder which one of us is the real big brother.

(Picky joins you.)



Hey, !
I was too busy to investigate, but I heard a child's voice on the hilltop.
I'm a busy man, but when I do a job, I do it well.  I'm a man's man.

Hey , hiya buddy!
A meteorite fell down and went boom!  It was a real mess for a while.
I was fine because I always eat garlic and work out to help make my body stronger.
However, the weaker citizens probably fainted.
I also want to tell you... whoops!
I almost told you about my...
Uh, by the way , did you check my billboard?
I wrote the message myself.
That's my real job, you know... I'm a billboard guy.
Why don't you check out my work?

, buddy... I have something to tell you, and only you.
Can you come visit me later, alone?

Sigh.  I wonder when the cops will leave...



Hey you, the board says   Couldn't you read it? Yes No 
What a rebellious kid!  Come to the Onett Police Station later!

So you just didn't want to read the sign, huh kid...
Get yer butt to the Onett Police Station later!

What a rebellious kid!  Come to the Onett Police Station later!



, I'm doing watch-out duty for the hideout.
Can you take over? Yes No 
You're busy.  I understand.

, that rocks!
Yesterday, I finally became a hideout member.  Please come back and visit.

Ah!
So you've realized that this is our hideout? Yes No 
(Oh!...  Hmmm)
This is not a hideout!

Just kidding.  Being watch-out is my job.

You're busy.  I understand.

I must totally stand out...

(Oh!...  Hmmm)
This is not a hideout!



This shack was locked by someone from City Hall, so we can't use it.
The reason it was closed was 'cause a punk named Frank may have trashed the place.
What a drag.
We can't even change our clothes, and hotels are too expensive...

Wow.  You opened the door!  All right!
Here's a trinket for good luck.  It's the !

Do you like traveling too?

I decided that... you have too many items to carry, and are unable to carry more.
After you've organized your items why don't you come back.



Yep, that's the key!  Hurry and open the door.



A library is a nice place to learn stuff.
I got a lot of info about EarthBound.
You can borrow maps for nothing!

If she's in a good mood, a lady in the library will kiss you.

It's a good idea to talk to lots of people.

What a cute, yellow backpack.

Hey!  You have lipstick on your cheek.

(I am not your enemy.
I am simply your average run-of-the-mill mole.
Would you like some hints on fighting enemies?)Yes No 
(Ah, I see...
You've already got a good grasp of how to fight effectively.)

(Listen carefully.
My hint involves which way you are facing when a battle with an enemy occurs.
If you allow enemies to approach you from your back or side, they may get a surprise opening attack.
When they approach you this way, your TV screen, no... no...
I mean the world in front of you will show a red swirl for a second.
On the other hand, if you approach an enemy from the back or side, you may get a surprise opening attack.
In that case, your TV...  Oops again!
...The world in front of you shows a green swirl.
The point is, try to fight so that you always have the advantage.)

(Ah, I see...
You've already got a good grasp of how to fight effectively.)



The arcade is full of Sharks.  I can't play there.

Hurray!  The Sharks are gone from the arcade!  Now I can go in...
Except I don't have any money to play the games...



A girl named  lives in Twoson.
Her mother runs a preschool out of their home.
I can't remember the name of the school, but I heard  's really special.
Why is she special?
I forgot to ask.  Oh, well...

Ah, it's you...  I've seen you in the newspaper.
Aren't you the extraordinary girl from Twoson? Yes No 
I see...  Maybe you're not especially special.

The point overlooking the sea has beautiful scenery.  It's over thataway.
Such a beautiful place gets me all choked up.



You look so helpless.  Are you okay?

You used to look much more helpless.



Rumor has it that the Sharks' boss is hanging out near the Giant Step.

Frank's not in the arcade.
He's in the hamburger shop smiling away...

I don't think Frank's a regular crazy and wild-type guy.



This town is out of control.
The wild boys are hanging out in the town and the cops have really been cracking down on everyone.
I'm considering moving to Twoson, a town in the south.

In this town, you're famous.
I heard you asked a Twoson girl out on a date.  What's her name?
You know, you have one of those baby faces that really attracts the girls, you lucky boy.

The wild punks have calmed down, but I still don't feel very safe.



If one of your friends becomes unconscious, you should visit them at the hospital.
You should check with the nurse receptionist, and she will release your friend.
It's a nice thing to remember, but it's all right if you forget.



Bow-wow!  (Don't you think you'll be needing a weapon?
Did you know the drug store sells things you can use?
...I knew about it.)

Bow-Wow!



Doesn't this house look good?  You can buy it for only $7500!
It has an ocean view, and the sunsets are beautiful.
Folks should have a place of their own.
Do you want to buy it? Yes  No 
You can't afford $7500?  It was a waste of time talking to you.

Hey!  You've got your own place now!

Thank you.
It's all yours now.  Take some time and relax.

You can't afford $7500?  It was a waste of time talking to you.



Hey!  You've got your own place now!

A house in such good condition can't be that cheap.



I must be the happiest man in the world.
I can practice my trumpet in this scenic spot.
I'll send my haunting melody throughout the town!



Do you want to start a fight, or what?

I won't fight you since you're stronger than I am.



Do you want to meet Frank?  You don't want Frank to beat you up, do you?

You look pretty healthy.



The road to Twoson  is closed.
You can't just squeeze through road blocks, either!
Onett is famous for roadblocks!

Hey, aren't you ?
Well, I got the okay from Chief Strong to let you through.
Take care of yourself.



Don't talk to me!  I'm on duty.
Until I have Chief Strong's permission, I can't let you through!

You're doing well.  Keep it up.
The  can be checked out at the library.
You can also use the map in Twoson.  It's really useful.

I know you've been asking around, so I'll tell you about Giant Step.
It...  seems...  to be quite a powerful spot.
Some kind of special power is stored there that allows certain people to perform wondrous feats.
However... a monster sucked up all the energy at that spot.
It's difficult to get to Giant Step.  That's all I know...
I suggest you collect more information on your own.
The entrance to the path leading to Giant Step is behind the touring entertainers' shack.
Pirkle, the Mayor of Onett, has a key to the shack.

It's not necessary to talk about it tonight.
It's late, scoot off to bed now.Yes  No 
Oh, .  You don't understand the importance of a good night's sleep!

Oh, .  You don't understand the importance of a good night's sleep!



Did you hear the big bang?  I think a meteorite landed nearby.
I want to be the first to see it.  Okay?
I am going to try to be the first to get there...



Don't panic!  It's just a... what?!... meteorite that... who?!... fell.
I just wanna... what?! ...go home...



Onett police are infamous for closing roads if something is going on.
We are going for the world record...



I want to return home, but the road is closed.
People are taking this meteorite situation too seriously!



Don't you know what time it is?!  Get yer butt home, pronto!



A meteorite has landed, the Sharks are running wild in town, you kids are wandering around, and, I'm hungry...  I hate my job!



It's dangerous to go to the hilltop.
Even if I advise you not to go, it won't stop you, will it?

Aaaaah--h...
If I yawn like this... it looks like I'm goofing off.
Aaaaah--h...  ...yes, it does...



Hey, you!  Don't you know what time it is?



Clear out. Get out of my way.  Clear out. Get out of my way.  Clear out. Get out of my way.
Clear out. Of way out get my
Whoops, my mistake...  I mean 



Shh.  Shh!



Nice timing, .  Will you do something about Pokey?
He's driving me nuts.  Are you two friends? Yes  No 
You're not friends, but aren't you neighbors?
C'mon, help me out here!

And you live in the house next to his...  I see...

You're not friends, but aren't you neighbors?
C'mon, help me out here!



That meteorite looks different than usual.
It's strange and marvelous... as well as mysterious...  ooooo!...



Hey, .
Don't be rubberneckin'.  You're gettin' in the cops, oops...
I mean officer's way!
You can go home now.
Tomorrow I, Pokey, will tell you more about the strange meteorite.
I'm fine here, but you're bugging the officers!

I heard there's a big foot print on the hilltop behind this shack.
I haven't seen it myself...  It's just a rumor.

Uh, huh.  
The big foot print is called Giant Step.  What a way cool name!



What?  You want to meet our boss, Frank?
He's in the backyard of the game arcade, thinking about peace and love.
You might want to visit him.



I heard there's a guy who stops to read each bulletin board he encounters.
Then he says,   Is that you?



Oh, oh...  The road's closed again.
It's Onett's claim to fame!



Do Not Enter




35 dollars per night for a single room.



(Treasure Hunter!  This is Lier X. Agerate's house!)



(Caution!  There are still lots of fires burning here and there.  It's HOT!)

(Seems like a big meteorite landed here not too long ago.)

There is something shiny that you can reach.
Do you want to try and get it? Yes No 

You don't have any more space.



(Looks like quite a piece of work...)



If this is a sign of what lies below, I just need a little time.
My destiny is to find and dig up the buried treasure.
I'll eat garlic and work out to help strengthen myself.
Go home now.  You're getting in the way of my work.
You may start to get greedy thoughts...

Hey , pal.
There was a man who insisted that he buy the golden statue, so I sold it to him.
It's not that I needed the money...
It's just that his unbridled mania affected me.
As you know, I'm a sucker for sentiment.
Bye, for now.

Go ahead and laugh at me.
But when I do a job, I do it well.  I'm a man's man.
When the game is over, I may be a hero.
You might ignore me now, but you'll see later...

You might ignore me now, but you'll see later...



(The Golden Statue is glowing strangely...)



You finally got here.
This is the first  location.  But it's mine now.
Take it from me, if you dare...

Only  can absorb the power of this place.



This is the cycle shop !
Bicycles are so much fun and are so convenient...
It's a lot faster than walking.
You'll be really popular with the biking crowd.
Do you want a bicycle? Yes  No 
Oh... you don't know how to ride a bike.
Me neither.

You know that two people can't ride a bike, but did you know that you can't ride a bike when you are carrying an unconscious friend's stuff?
Carrying a lot of items and riding aroud is impossible for you.

Hey!  Stubby legs!
Do you wanna ride a bike?
That's not gonna work... two people on one bike is strictly forbidden.

Unfortunately,
 we don't have any more bikes for sale.  We only have rentals.
Do you want to rent one? Yes  No 
I really like your straight-forward style.
I'll tell you what, I'll let you borrow a bike for free.
You know that two people can't ride on one bicycle, so of course three or four people on a bike would be impossible!
Did you also know that you can't ride a bike with anything following you?
Teddy bears, for example...
Carrying a bear and riding is impossible for you.
And don't even think about riding a bike into a cave.

Oh... you don't know how to ride a bike.
Me neither.

You're here to return your bike?
Look how low your seat is!  Geez, you must have short legs.
That's it!  I'll call you stubby legs!

Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.  You've already borrowed a bicycle.

You're here to return the bicycle? Yes  No 
Well, don't forget to return it...  You're gonna have to sooner or later.

Didn't you  already borrow a bicycle?  We don't have any more right now...

You have  too many items.  Why don't you get rid of something and come back.
I know you want it now, but my hands are tied...

Well, don't
 forget to return it...  You're gonna have to sooner or later.



Whistle, whistle anywhere.  It makes me smile  all the while.
I'm 's mother.  I'm busy taking care of these kids.
You shouldn't worry about .  She has a guardian angel, it seems.

You've lost some weight since I saw you last, .

Why don't you drop by more often?  I'm working at making better .

You shouldn't worry about .  She has a guardian angel, it seems.

Yahoo!  I knew it!  You saved .

I know, I'll call it a Hand-aid!
Did you meet Dad?
He is sorry that he suspected Mr. Everdred of Burglin Park.   

Well, here you are, .
I'll make you some , even though I'm not a very good cook.

What's that?  You're being a little impatient...
You need to sell, use or drop something.  After that, I can give this to you.


Is that you, ?  Oh, I thought she would be back, but not yet...
Oh no, I'm not worried... I'll be okay.

Yahoo!  I knew it!  You got back here with no problem.
Isn't  with you?

I won't say I'm not worried.

Well, I wanted to play with , but she's gone somewhere...

I'm not going to ask the two of you where you were wandering...

Thank you for saving .  You are my hero.

Help !  Hurry, hurry!



 is like a mother to me.
You may not be able to comprehend my emotions.
I might have a baby face, but I possess the mind of an adult.
I beg your pardon.

, you look  nice and healthy.  What great timing having you show up now!

You know, I thought I saw her for a second out of the corner of my eye... maybe I was just dreaming...



When I grow up, I wanna be  juuuust like .

You skinned your knee, huh.

What happened to ?

When I get big, I'm gonna be grown-up .
Then, later I'll be old lady .



So, you wanna see ?
Many come here to see her miraculous powers, but they're just leeches.
So... are you from a TV station, or what? Yes  No 
To meet you or not to meet you can only be decided by .

So you're !
You're the one that was in  's dream.
You will save the world!
Let me go call .
She doesn't seem to be here.
I wonder where she went?  I'm sorry, could you come back later?

You're a very strong, young man.  My opinion of you has changed.
Perhaps you should continue dating .
Just treat her right...
Come by and visit anytime.
You can even sleep on the living room couch instead of the one in the den...

You're both fine... I'm so relieved!
Why don't you get some rest here? Yes  No 
Come on, why don't you put your dogs up  and reeeelax.

Goodbye .  Don't worry, I won't cry anymore...

Oh !
, thank you so much!
You must be the boy who will save the world, like in  's dream.
, I'm sure you'd be a big help to .
It's not every day a father lets his daughter embark on a journey to save the world!
Dad, don't worry about me.
 and I will be able to take care of ourselves.
In Threed, the next town, we'll meet another friend.
If the three of us can combine our power, no one can beat us.
Now wipe your eyes, blow your nose, and smile before we take off.
Goodbye .  Don't worry, I won't cry anymore...

  's not home yet.
Everdred in Burglin Park might know something.
Oh, boy!  Now I'm really worried.

Now where did she go?
I'm sorry, could you come back after a while?

Please leave.
My daughter doesn't want to talk to media monkeys like you.

To meet you or not to meet you can only be decided by .

Hey!  Come on in!
No, I don't need to hear about what happened...   will be okay.
Why don't you just rest for now.
You know where the couch in the den is...

Oh !
So even a tomboy like you thinks of her father occasionally!
You should rest, seeing how this is your own home.
How about we share a piece of pie like we used to?  Ha ha ha!

, you'll sleep on the couch in the den...

Come on, why don't you put your dogs up  and reeeelax.

Oh, !
.....
Am I dreaming?  I feel like she just came home...

Where's ?
He isn't here?  I just wanted to thank him.
You know, I bet he's the boy you dreamt would save the world...

Hmm... I understand.
So you're a friend of 's?
Look me in the eye...  Yes, you're telling the truth.
Would you like to get some shut eye?

, I guess it's time for you to go home.
Everyone is probably worried about you.



Greetings.  I'm Orange Kid, the inventor.
Have you heard of me?  I'm a bit embarrassed about my reputation.
I have a lot of inventions in development, but I'm running short of cash.
I'm basically a happy-go-lucky person, so I'm not worried.
You know, I'm working on this machine that would really help you in Peaceful Rest Valley.
I hope it's ready soon... what?
You're actually willing to help finance the project? Yes  No 
I guess I was just too hopeful.  Oh well, never mind.

Well, you never invested in my genius, did you?
You had no idea of what I could do...
*chortle*
You sorry loser.

Let me give you my new

Please use it for spreading peace and goodwill on Earth.

You didn't invest any money in my venture, but someone else donated a few million bucks, so everything is great.
So would you like to invest, say, 50 bucks? Yes  No 
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
...And you never heard how much money I got, too.  Right? *wink* *wink*...

Oh goody!  Would it be okay to get $200 to buy materials? Yes  No 
Thank you very much!
Your support should have a tremendous impact on all mankind.

Did you come here to get your investment money back?
No?  Can you wait a little longer?
I promise I'll finish my brilliant invention.
I rely on your support, even though I am a super genius.

I'm hard at
 work... don't worry, my brilliant invention will be ready soon.
Okay, okay...  I'll get back to work!

Ah ha!  You have too many items.

Well, perhaps you shouldn't be yappin' about having cash then, buddy.

I'm having more trouble than I expected.
I found a problem in one of Einstein's theories...

Well, I have sort of neglected doing my housework...
I know it's a bit of a pig sty, but anyway...
I'm Apple Kid.
I haven't taken a bath in quite a while, so I may be kind of stinky.
By the way, I'm starving.  Do you have something to eat?
If you do, can I have some?
Well,
 go ahead and make yourself comfortable anyway.  You can flop down  anywhere.
What can you give me?
Please choose something edible... I'm  not a garbage can, you know.
Thanks.  You seem very nice.  Uh, I wonder  if...
Maybe you would like to invest some money in my inventions?
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Oh.  Excuse me.  I mean thank you!
By the way, I could really use $200.
Thank you.  I won't let you down.

Maybe you shouldn't spend too much time wandering around Twoson.

Thank you.  I won't let you down.

It seems like you are expecting something from me.
I am a mouse.  No one has given me a name yet.

You took care of my master.
In return, I want to give you this.  Please take it and say nothing.

Oh!  I must be in your way! *zziipp!*

Unfortunately, you have too many items.  Therefore, I can't give this to you.



I am a mouse.  No one has given me a name yet.



Hello, please present your ticket.

Sorry, the show is on hold for a while.

See you.

Oh, pardon me.



Please show me your ticket.

How do you do?

The show is on hold for a while.

Here you  go.  Hurry!  You're just in time to see the Runaway Five show!



I guess I lost my ticket, so now I can't get in.
The ticket counter at the department store was even sold out.

*Sniff* I suppose I'll never see the Runaway Five's show again.



Oh, here you are!  Hurry up, you're just in time to see the Runaway Five show.



Lucky of the Runaway Five told me I could go backstage, but I don't have a pass.
I'm sure security will stop me.  Hey!  Really?  You have a pass?
I can't believe it!  Can you take me with you, please please please?
I could pose as your sister.  Yes?  This rocks.  Let's go.
Ooo. My heart is pounding.

I'm gonna  miss the Runaway Five when they finally leave.  But that's life!

Thank you for your kindness!



You want to see Poochyfud, the manager?
Right through this door, please.

I'm not sure what happened, but it looked like it was good news.



The Runaway Five are going to be a world-famous band someday.



Do you like baseball? Yes  No 
Ah... I see.
Well, you don't look like you could figure out a sophisticated game like baseball anyway.

I knew it!  Your cap gave it away.

Ah... I see.
Well, you don't look like you could figure out a sophisticated game like baseball anyway.

You have the graceful movement of a baseball player.
I'm on a baseball team, so I can recognize these things.



Hey, hey, hey!  Don't get too close to me.
I just farted, heh, heh... sorry.



You kids are bouncing around, talking to everyone.  It's getting annoying.



A young fan like you really gets into the Runaway Five's music?
Wow, I'm impressed!



Seeing the Runaway Five on stage is my life...

The Runaway Five are so sexy!  My husband definitely is... in need of some help in that area!



When I sit close to the stage, sometimes I get sweat or spit on me from the Runaway Five.

Oh, that was almost too much!



Hey, you ... how did you get ?  What are you, the owner's  or something? kids tickets kid a ticket



I came here because it's tough to get in, but I'm kind of disappointed.
There are no good-looking waitresses, and there is no room for me to show off my latest dance moves.



Y'know, I think it's pretty tacky to entertain our company's business partner by taking him to a Runaway Five show.
...But since I'm new to the company, I better just toe the line.



Well, well... I got a little kid here talking to me like he' s an adult.
I give you one thing---you got guts, kid... an adult.
I give you one thing---you got guts, kid...



They seem too proud... I mean, they just filled up this little music hall after all...



My boyfriend lost the ticket that I gave him.
He's waiting outside the entrance.
He's got butter fingers, but he's nice.



La la La la
I just love ragtime!



La la Mi mi I'm tone-deaf.  My daughter brought me here.
Fa la La mi.



I'm so excited!  I might just wet myself.  My heart is going pitter patter!



Shaba do wap, diddly dee da.  Shaba di doo bee, bop wah.
I got those debt blues,  hm mm mm.
If I had 10,000 dollars, I could pay off my debts and move on to the next town.
I wonder if our bus still runs.  It may be rusted out...

Mr. 
Poochyfud, the Manager, is looking for you.  I wonder what he wants?



Don't try to use your play money here, kid.
Oh... my... gosh...!  That's not real money, is it?  Wow!



Well, yeah, in the old days, there was lots o' dancers and acts at this theater.
'cept now, we're the only act playin' here.
We even gone into debt here, so we're pretty near stuck, hyuk, hyuk, hyuk.
The folks of Twoson'll enjoy the Runaway Five show for quite a few years, it looks like ta me.

Ya got a  once in a lifetime opportunity.  How 'bout watchin' one more show?

So, whaddya think?
Do ya wanna see one more show?  Yes   No 
So, our sound is too much for ya, right?  I figured as much.

This is your chance fer a once in a lifetime event.

So, our sound is too much for ya, right?  I figured as much.



Well, hello!  Ya got cash!  And some nice stuff ta boot!  Hyuk, hyuk, hyuk.



Hey, ya get to see our show, you lucky kid!  I hope ya pay attention.

That was a great gig!
We can't be this good all the time, can we? 



If you give him a chance, the theater manager will cheat you out of your money, he he he.



I want some bread.
I need the coinage.
I want more dough all the time.

I didn't make a spectacle of myself, did I?



That is exactly what I want.
I can't believe that you have that much...



I wrote the lyrics to most of the Runaway Five songs.
Money, that's what I want  money, that's what is hot  money, that's what I want money, it's what we ain't got 'cept freedom, freedom, freedom is what we've really sought!

Cash, that's what I want  cash, that's what is hot  cash, that's what I want
...hey, I just made up a new song.

Money, that's what I want  money, that's what is hot  money, that's what I want money, it's what we ain't got 'cept freedom, freedom, freedom is what we've really sought!



Wow!  10,000 dollars!  I can make another song now.
Ten G's,  ten G's.  That's dollars, baby, dollars.  Yeah yeah yeah.



The Runaway Five owe me a lot of money.
They'll stay here until they pay me back.
They might be here for 100 years, unless you decide to pay off their debt...  Heh, heh, heh.

Pardon?  You want to talk about money?
How about later, after the show, even if we're talking big bucks.
I've got definite rules about how I handle my money matters...

The Runaway Five are free to leave.
I've got no complaints now that I have my money.

The Runaway Five owe me a lot of money.

Yipes!  You surprised me.  Now I'm not sure what to do.
I got the money, of course, and now the Runaway Five are free to leave.
I've got no complaints now that I have my money.

Yipes!  You surprised me.  Now I'm not sure what to do.
I got the money, of course, and now the Runaway Five are free to leave.
I've got no complaints now that I have my money.

'scuse me?  What's that you got there?  Let me take a  reeeeal close look.

Well, what do you know?
This little nipper took us from a nightmare to a dream...

Ow!  This means we can get out of this dump!

I'm a good driver.  C'mon, I'll show you.

All right, let's move on to the next town.
I'm sure our ol' hunk o' junk will get us there...



Wah ha ha ha ha!  Why don't we chat later-after  we've locked horns!
Yes, I'm Everdred, boss of Burglin Park.
When I jumped off the roof, I twisted my ankle.
Anyway, I lost and nothing will change that.
You know, you're pretty strong.
Yeah, I know that you want to find out about a girl named .
She went off to a secret hideout in the Peaceful Rest Valley.
A chubby boy and a weird guy in a blue outfit have kidnapped her, though.
They said that they were going to make  some sort of human sacrifice.
They were definitely hard-core strange.
You know, she might be gone already.  You'd better hurry.
If you save , be sure to come back here, okay?  Don't forget!

Please use the 10,000 dollars any way you wish.
You cannot refuse my generosity, just accept it.

I was going to ask you to be my partner, but I know you'll refuse.  It's written all over your face.
If you accepted, I was going to give you some money.
Actually, I can't keep the money now anyway.  Let me give this to you.
It's 10,000 dollars.
Use the money any way you like.  You cannot refuse my generosity.  Just accept it.
Now I plan on looking for the evil Mani Mani Statue that Lier X. Agerate unearthed in Onett.
I'll see you at another time, in another space.

First, you must take her to her parents.  They're really worried.
I also have something to give you, so be sure to come back here.
Promise?  All right.

If you save , be sure to come back here, okay?  Don't forget!

I need to talk to .
Even if you're his friend, I won't talk to you.

Your backpack is filled with junk.  Get rid of something!
I'll put the money in a safe place until you get back.

!
I thought you were with your little hero, the kid in the red cap.
You seem cold.

I heard  that you've been pretty proud of yourself since you saved 's life.
Think about it, you didn't actually save her.
Come back when you've accomplished something.



Welcome to Mach Pizza!
We don't sell pizza here.  We only deliver.
Let me give you our number so you can place an order sometime.
The best pizza is Mach Pizza.  The number is... *psst psst psst*.
You got that?

I wonder if we're going out of business?
I thought business was pretty good.
Oh well, I don't think I want to deliver pizza.  I'd just get too tired...

*Munch*munch*gulp*
Uh... no, I didn't take a piece of pizza.  I would never think of doing that!
It was delicious, though.  Enjoy!
As you may know, you need to order by phone, okay?

Welcome to Hotel Twoson.



You must be quite a rich boy to stay at such a nice, first class hotel like this one.






Reports that the Mayor stopped the Sharks have been proven to be false&gt;



  Follower states Happy Happyism is wrong
Follower claims temporary insanity...&gt;

&lt; found safe!  Parents delighted to have her back&gt;



This morning's Twoson Tribune...
...Ooops!  My mistake... I brought the TwosonStar newspaper instead...
Well, let me read this anyway...

...That's about it.

 into the graveyard in Threed&gt;

 in downtown Fourside&gt;





...There was no morning edition today...







There's an interesting advertisement in today's Twoson Tribune.

If so, the book  is your self-help guide to becoming more outgoing.
This title is now available at your local bookstore or library.&gt;





 Animals calm down! The town is at peace!&gt;

How about reading the newspaper before you go?

Here is this morning's Twoson Tribune headline...



What?

Good luck, ok?

Ah, ha ha!

Yeah, yeah!

Dang me!

You're annoying!

Mmm?

Geez...

Pardon?

Huh?

So... what?

Here, get yourself a juice or something...
*Ka-ching*
( got 50 dollars.)

Oh ho ho!
See ya!

Is it cold today?

It's sooo hot today.
It rocks!

Ah!  Hah Hahhhh...

Later days, pal!

Hey, you!



Do I have a mushroom on my head?  Yes   No 
That's what I thought...
Recently, I couldn't walk quite right.  It was because of this mushroom.
It's actually kind of fun, so I'll leave it there.

Don't you think I look stylish with the mushroom?

That's what I thought...
Recently, I couldn't walk quite right.  It was because of this mushroom.
It's actually kind of fun, so I'll leave it there.

You're one of those people that says  right off the bat to any question, right?









My shot didn't hurt.
I'm sure everyone is talking about it, but don't worry about me.



I got bit by zombies in Threed, the next town over, so I'm stuck in this hospital.
I left something good at the Threed Hospital, but now I can't go get it because the bus can't get through the tunnel.

I'm in  perfect, tip-top health now.  I just wish I had more visitors.
*cough* *hack, hack* *cough*



Thank you!  You've made me so happy!
After my life, this is the second most important thing to me!
Because you're so kind, I want to give you this .
It's a souvenir from Scaraba.



I had an argument with my friend about Happy-Happyism.

My friend  who joined the Happy-happy religion came to see me a while ago.
We've became friends again.



I wanted to see the circus in Threed, the next town over, but I hurt my leg in the Peaceful Rest Valley.

You look healthy, but you spend a lot of time at the hospital.
My story is the same.  Do you want to hear it again? Yes  No 
Well, it's not important.

Okay, you asked for it... ready?
It's just a hunch, but I think the ghosts in the tunnel don't like anything upbeat and cheerful.
When I was driving in the tunnel,
I was playing some grooving tunes and the ghosts moved slower.
I think the ghosts can't stand anything positive.

Well, it's not important.

I wanted to see the circus in Threed, the next town over, but I hurt my leg in the Peaceful Rest Valley.



To take the bus, or not to take the bus... hmmm.
I get scared pretty easily...

To take the bus, or not to take the bus... hmm.
I get sick pretty easily...



I was in the last war, so I'm not scared of ghosts.
Actually, I'm more scared of my old lady, ha!



This town's bus system is a little strange.
Be sure to check the bus stop signs.  I wonder who came up with this system?



That's right, I'm a bus driver.  For now, I'm resting.
Life is long... take it easy,
Why don't you check out your town map and learn about this area.
 chubs.
 girlie girl.
 specs.
 pajama boy.

You don't  have a town map?  You didn't borrow one from the Onett library?



My daughter left for the big city to become a superstar.
She's using a stage name--Vein... oh, vein something... she's working hard.

I got a  letter from my daughter.  She wants me to see her next show.
A book of photographs of her is coming out soon.
I really hope she kept her clothes on...  Times have sure changed...





Dad and Mom have left for Happy-Happy Village.
They wanna meet with the founder of the religion there.

Now I get it.  You're not from this town.
So, where do you come from?  Can you play with me again someday?

Dad and Mom said they won't go to Happy-Happy Village.
I'm not sure why, but now I'm happy.



You woke me from that nightmare.



I'm sorry that I made you worry...



Did you know that two young inventors live in this town?
I want to invent something, too.

The other day, did you speak to a boy who invents stuff?



I have a lot of old, broken junk, but I hate to throw anything away.
If you have a friend who is knowledgeable about mechanics, that person might be able to fix something for you overnight...
Man, a friend like that would be so handy...

Oh, that's good.
Please stop by again.

Do you want to buy a ticket for the Runaway Five show?  Yes   No 
Oh, I mistook you for a customer.

Sorry.  The Chaos Theater is being remodeled.  There is no concert.

The main floor and balcony seats are sold out.
We only have box seats, which cost 20 dollars.  Would that be okay?
Oh, wait... the box seats sold out a long time ago.  Oops.  My mistake.
The box seats are the most popular.

Oh, I mistook you for a customer.



This department store isn't crowded.  I like that.

Didn't you talk to me before?  I believe I said,
... or something to that effect.







I think that my grandchild is older than you.  He's a famous inventor.
He lives here, and people call him Orange Kid.
He seems to be popular with the girls, because he's... groovy?

We've  bumped into each other before.  You seem to love department stores.
I do too.



I heard a meteorite crashed onto a hilltop near Onett.
That must have been exciting!

I saw you a long time ago... maybe about the time that the meteorite hit Onett...







I wanna visit my boyfriend in Threed 'cept the bus won't go there.
I wonder why.



Happy-Happy Village is getting to be more and more blue.  Do you get it?

Hey, it's the boy who wears the same outfit all the time!
You seem happy enough, but who knows?

You're always wearing the same clothes...
Do you wash them, or what? Yes No 
Well, they look clean enough, but who knows?

Someday, Happy-Happy Village will be truly happy.

Hmm.  I wouldn't have believed it...

Well, they look clean enough, but who knows?



Yum yum... mmm... I'm eating a skip sandwich.
It makes you want to start skipping!
I saw it on a TV ad, and I just had to try one.
I'll bet I can really move after eating this...



That teddy bear they sell over there...I heard it helps in battle.
I don't know what they're talking about.
It looks like a plain ol' teddy bear to me...



I always feel much better after hearing my mom's voice over the phone.
I was really homesick recently, and my mom cheered me right up.
You should call your mom sometime.
Believe me, those melancholy feelings will be gone before you know it.



Welcome!
Would you like me to tell you about Twoson? Yes  No 
It's too much trouble for me too.

I've been giving out info about Twoson for years now.
I'll quit this job and I'll, tee hee, get married.

Twoson has a modern, clean hotel.
There is a hospital and the wonderful Chaos Theater.
There is the Polestar preschool, and a nice bus station.
If you're curious, you might want to check out Burglin Park.  It's exciting.
East of the town, you find the Peaceful Rest Valley.
On the other side of the valley is Happy-Happy Village.
There's also a pizza parlor.
Do you want to know anything else?
Well, tee hee, I don't know anything else.

It's too much trouble for me too.



Burglin Park seems kind of dangerous, but there's some great stuff there.



I hear that a girl named  was kidnapped while helping out at the Polestar preschool.

I heard that  beat up the kidnapper.  She's my favorite!

I heard that you, , beat up the kidnapper.  You're my favorite!



I saw some weird bad guy following .  This guy gave me the creeps.

Kidnapping is wrong!
I'll be careful not to kidnap anyone!



I see that you're young but have had some adventures.
I think that  would be a good friend for you.

Just as I thought, you two make such a nice couple!

Just as I thought, you two make such a nice couple!
Well, I think you're cute...
But I'm near-sighted, too...

My grandson is playing a game called 
He's now talking to a plain, old lady in Twoson.
I heard that the game has some messages that are just there for fun.



If you go to the east, you could run into trouble.
Peaceful Rest Valley and Happy-Happy Village are waiting for you.
I've also heard that there are UFO's in the Peaceful Rest Valley.

Well, my thoughts on happiness have changed...



People in Happy-Happy Village are fanatical about a strange religion.
Maybe they've got some sort of bad fever.  Be careful.

I'm glad to see you so healthy.



(There was a kidnapping!
Believe me, even though I'm just a dog.  Woof!)

(You're fantastic...you even take time to talk to animals.)





I own an antique shop.
No one is buying or selling anything, so I was thinking of selling the  Sign that sits in front of me.
It's only 98 dollars.  Please buy it.  Yes   No 
I bet you'll regret not buying it.

So, did the  Sign help you?
Yeah, I was the one that sold it to you.

If you want to sell something, use this  Sign.
Customers will flock to you.

I bet you'll regret not buying it.

Oh, you can't buy it 'cause you're poor.  That's too bad.

I can't help you if you're carrying too many things...



Hey, why don't you buy the world's greatest Ruler.Yes  No 
Do you think it's hot?  Look, I didn't steal it...

Thank you!  That's  clams!Yes  No 
Here you go, one Ruler!

Do you think it's hot?  Look, I didn't steal it...

Here you go, one Ruler!

You said yes, even though you need a lot more money.

You said  - that's short and to the point.  But you don't have any more room...
Get rid of something and come back.  I'll be here.



I sell fresh eggs.  They're nutritious!
Please buy this beautiful, beautiful egg!  Please? Yes  No 
You won't get through your teen years without at least one egg.
Please buy this beautiful egg.  Please!Yes  No 
Ok, but your teen years will be ruined just because you didn't buy an Egg.

You're concerned about your health, even though you're young.
That'll be  big ones.Yes No 
Okay, here you are... one egg to go!

You won't get through your teen years without at least one egg.
Please buy this beautiful egg.  Please!Yes  No 
Ok, but your teen years will be ruined just because you didn't buy an Egg.

Ok, but  your teen years will be ruined just because you didn't buy an Egg.

Okay, here you are... one egg to go!

Hey, I'm not just giving it away...

Eggs are easily broken.
There's no way to stuff it in with your other things if you have no more room...



The boss of Burglin Park is Everdred.
He's got ties to burglaries and kidnappings in this area.
He's a scary guy.

I heard that the kidnapped girl was saved.
What?  You saved her?
That's hard to believe.  You don't seem like the hero-type to me.

Everdred is
 asking for you.  He has a present to give you.  Please...

Will you give me 1,000 dollars?
I'll give you all my support.Yes  No 
I'm glad you turned me down.
I just want to be an unknown little punk.

You shouldn't give away 1,000 dollars so easily.
Let me give it back to you.
Do you think I'm really an honest, reliable person?

I'm glad you turned me down.
I just want to be an unknown little punk.





It makes me feel good to just sit and look at my pots...

...I like pots, but what I really want is the tool shop  Sign.
It's right there.  Should I steal it?  Hmmm...





Are you looking for that so-called genius, Apple Kid?
As a true genius, I'll tell you that he's in Burglin Park, looking for you.



Let's go to Threed!
Our tour bus is too loud for any ghosts to bother us.
Do you want a ride? Yes  No 
If ya change your mind, come back anytime.

Oh yeah!  Let's go!  Get on the bus!

If ya change your mind, come back anytime.



If I had some connections, I could waltz right in, but I'm just a regular joe.



Of course, Everdred isn't a good person, but he's actually quite warm-hearted for a crime boss.

What?  Everdred is gone?  That's crap!  Don't believe it.



Everdred has always watched over Burglin Park.
That's why we don't have to bribe any crooked cops.

Even if Everdred has passed on, he'll keep watch over us from... from...wherever he's at.



I'm starting a line here.  I want a ticket for today's show, but I may not get it.



I love standing in a queue.  I also love words that start with 
Queen, quiet, quick...



We--that's right--we are the Runaway Five.
We're popular, but not rich.
We're bein' cheated by this theater, and we're really deep in debt!

You're with a girl today.  Ya must be pretty popular.
How about introducin' her to my bandmate?  He's right there.

Hey, someone was looking for ya.

Thanks for talking to me.
Didn't ya go off looking for some girls?



We may be popular, but that girl who lives at the house with the preschool is the talk of the town.
I wanna see her someday.

Hey, ya came with !
Then you deserve a present, playboy.
Here's a .  You can get into our shows with this!

Hey, you're !
A boy with a red cap seemed to be lookin' for ya.

I heard  you're workin' hard tryin' to find the girl who lives at the preschool.
If ya find her, bring her to our concert.

With that , you can even get into our dressing room.
Come with your girlfriend...  We'll be waitin'.

It seems like you've got an awful lot of junk.
Get rid of somethin' and come back for the pass.



It's just a hunch, but I think the ghosts in the tunnel don't like anything upbeat and cheerful.
When I was driving in the tunnel,
I was playing some grooving tunes and the ghosts moved slower.
I think the ghosts can't stand anything positive.



I heard  was kidnapped, but it's still unconfirmed.

This town feels so much more peaceful and safe...

Congratulations on solving the kidnapping.



I'm nuts about this one kid inventor.
No, not that airheaded, dweeby Apple Kid.
I'm talking about the incredibly hot Orange Kid!

The Orange Kid is deep into a world-class invention.
It must be hard being an ultra-genius.



That stupid slob, the Apple Kid, always asks me for something to eat.
He's the inventor--he should invent some food for himself.

That stupid slob, the Apple Kid, is suddenly missing.
I think the town seems cleaner somehow.



I am a mouse.
My master, Apple Kid, has been waiting for you.
We started to nod off while waiting...



I'm feeling really out of it because I've been working all night, but finally the  is ready.
This machine will eradicate all pencil-shaped figures in just one second.
It's incredibly powerful.  Just don't use it near a shop that sells pencils.
Here, it's yours now.
If I invent some other brilliant item, I'll call you.

This  machine will eradicate all pencil-shaped figures in just one second.
It's incredibly powerful.  Just don't use it near a shop that sells pencils.
I'll call you if I invent another brilliant item.

Oh, it won't fit in your backpack.
Come back after you have gotten rid of some stuff.





I'm thinking about catching a bus to Threed.  I heard there are ghosts along the way.
I wonder if the bus will have to turn around and come back.

To get to Threed, the bus is most convenient.



Didn't I see you at the Topolla Theater in Fourside?
So you're a Runaway Five groupie, too!



 isn't here!
She suddenly left, and I don't know where she went.

(He's smiling).

Oh, !  Uh... sorry, I thought you were .



I came to buy condiments...
I wonder what would be good...
The right condiment makes a dish taste better, while the wrong one makes it taste worse.
If the condiment matches the food, you will get more power than if you ate the food item plain.



(I'm not an enemy.  I'm just a friendly mole.
I'll tell you how to distinguish between your friends and enemies.
It's easy to tell an enemy just by looking at them.
Enemies look like humans with weird-colored faces.  Beware of them.
However... you can't get more powerful if you avoid your enemies.)

(You listened to my advise and fought courageously.  You rock!)



Woooooooo!  (Go back, go back!)



( checked the bus schedule.)
(It looks like the next bus will come pretty soon.)

Danger!
Do not stand in the street.
(Read the schedule from the sidewalk.)

(It looks like it's going to be a while before the next bus comes.)



(Happy-Happy Village ahead.)



I always see you walking around.
Walking is good for your health.



(Home of Apple Kid, inventor)



(Home of Orange Kid, inventor)




50 dollars per night for a single room.



(One of the biggest markets you'll ever find--now in Burglin Park.)



(Runaway Five tour bus.)



(The Mani Mani Statue is glowing strangely...)



Thanks for coming!  I've been waiting for you.
I need your assistance to help make the world blue and change it into a happy and peaceful society.
Will you be my right-hand assistant?  Yes   No 
If you don't want to be my right hand, my left would be just fine...
Just kidding!  Your existence is a problem for me and my religion.
Defy me, and I'll end your pitiful game!

Please  forgive me, if you can...  I just wanted to have a normal life.
I apologize to everyone.
Here's the key to open the jail in the mountain cabin where  is being held.
Take the key and go.

Please  forgive me, if you can...  I just wanted to have a normal life.
I apologize to everyone.

You fool, I have drawn you into my trap.

If you  don't want to be my right hand, my left would be just fine...
Just kidding!  Your existence is a problem for me and my religion.
Defy me, and I'll end your pitiful game!

Do you see the Mani Mani Statue behind me...
Since I got the statue, I have been doing peculiar things.
Please forgive me, if you can...  I just wanted to have a normal life.
I apologize to everyone.
Here's the key to open the jail in the mountain cabin where  is being held.
Take the key and go.

Your backpack is full...
You should take this even if you need to throw away one of your items.

Carpainter's lightning was reflected by the Franklin Badge.

Carpainter's lightning was reflected by the Franklin Badge.



Aaiiiieeeeee!  I screamed...
'cause I didn't know what else to do!

So you're the boy that... that...
You went after Mr. Carpainter and... you're awesome!



Blue, blue.
Oh, you'd like to be one of us?
Then, give up what  you're doing and go meet the great Mr. Carpainter as soon as possible.

Blue, blue.
Give up what you're  doing and go meet the great Mr. Carpainter as soon as possible.



Blue, blue.
...What?  I'm blocking you?  Ok, I'll move out of your way.

Blue, blue.
I moved out of your way.



Blue, blue.
...Don't bother us.  We're in the middle of prayer.
Okay, I'll move out of your way.  Go quickly!

Blue, blue.
...Is it your hobby or something to bother others while they pray?!



Blue, blue.
...What?  Are you saying that I'm only capable of walking in place?
That's not true, see!

Blue, blue.
You must need help, because you're just standing around!



Green, green.
Ooops, that's not it...  I'm still new at this.

Blue, blue.
Now I got it.  Blue, blue.



Blue, blue.
I'll stand somewhere else.

Blue, blue
Lagoon blue, blue.



Blew, blew.
I'm trying to learn how to whistle.
I heard that whistling makes one smile.  I'll practice over there.

Blew, blew.
Whistling is hard...



Blue, blue.
I say, ... or something like that.  So now I'll crush you!



Blue, blue.
Don't disrupt our meeting!  I'll stomp on you!



Blue, blue.
You strange, unmasked fellow.  Don't go to heaven!



Blue, blue.
Hey you!  Anti-blue boy!  You're getting on my nerves!



Blue, blue.
Those who aren't believers must not be good!  To eternity with you!



Blue, blue.
This should wake you up!  Aaaaaagghhh!!!



Blue, blue.
Your outfit... the color is wicked.



Blue, blue.
Why would a person who's not blue be here?



Blue, blue.
You can't be happy unless you know happy-happyism.



It looks like almost everyone woke up and left...



There are only three people remaining...
I don't want to stay.  I'll get out of here...



Sorry about everything!  Let's be buddies.



You don't seem to understand, so I'll explain it to you.
When the world is changed to blue, a peaceful country can be established.
Do you understand now?  Yes   No 
Although you don't understand now, some day you will.

Thanks, ahead of time.

I too was wrong in many ways.

I can tell by your face that you're only pretending to understand.
You just want something!

Although you don't understand now, some day you will.



You might misunderstand what I have to say,
But Carpainter's voice affects one's minds, like a hypnotist.

Seems like I'm no longer hypnotized.



We wanted to join the Happy-Happy religious group.
We're a married couple from Twoson.



Our child is waiting for us in Twoson.
As a souvenir we'd like to bring him some happiness.



This is the famous Happy-Happyism counseling office.
When you obtain happiness you should visit the Happy-Happyism headquarters.
It's located at the center of the village.



I not know you.
My kind are in valley over there.
Bye bye.

Hi, you.







The information on the back of the  reads as follows:
If you catch a cold, if you're ill, or if you can't seem to heal, if you're poisoned, if you're depressed, a refreshing herb is the real deal.
I know, it seems pretty iffy, but you should give it a try!



We're all like one big, happy family here in Happy Happy Village!
Basically, our policy is to only allow family members to stay here in the village.
However, if you are interested in learning about Happy Happyism, we may make an exception and let you stay for $.
Never have I heard such disrespect!  Get out and stay out!

Greetings, .  Please forgive my lecture earlier.
You are now welcome to stay free of charge.
Would you like to stay?
Very well.  Please come again, any time.

Are you prepared to show the proper respect to Mr. Carpainter now?
Blue... blue...

Very well... be sure to do your   chant before bed time.

Never have I heard such disrespect!  Get out and stay out!

Good morning.  Take care and good luck.

Excellent. 
 Please make yourself comfortable, on your blue sheets...
No, no, I'm just kidding!  Ha ha hah!

Very well.  Please come again, any time.

No faith...  No money...  You are a hopeless case.



Blue... blue.



Blue... blue...


 
What a horrible nightmare.  I somehow woke up.
, let's be friends again.
Please answer me.  I promise to be good. ...uh ...okay?
Hah!  I lied!  See you, sucker!



I'm monitoring those who don't pay at the food stand.

In a  different way than before, Mr. Carpainter has become a very good man.

They said  someone named Pokey stole all the food from the food stand.

You won this confrontation.
But the good side of you must ache with regret.  Ha ha ha.

Have you already paid?  Ok, ok.

I noticed you didn't pay!
You won this confrontation.
But the good side of you must ache with regret.  Ha ha ha.



One day, Mr. Carpainter received a revelation.
He now speaks the real truth.

I woke up from the dream.



Mr. Carpainter communicates with the divine, so he is able to deliver inspired messages.

Don't you  think the mental health of everyone in the village is improved?

We might have been listening to evil messages rather than good.



When I painted everything blue, as Mr. Carpainter said, my wife who had run out on me returned home!

Wow, it's been a long time.  Your cap...  Do you ever wash it?

My wife has run away for a second time.  I'm such a lucky man!



I think that those who won't paint everything blue are opposed to peace.
I want them all to listen, even if it requires kicking their butts.

I shouldn't be so desperate to chase after happiness.

We need to  return the town to its original colors.  I'll be very busy.



Blue, blue!
I wish for everything in this world to become blue.

Hey, long time no see.
You're a friend of the famous Runaway Five.

It was hard on the eyes to have everything blue.



You want to talk to Mr. Carpainter directly?
You must think you're pretty important, and boy do you have a lot of nerve!
You deserve to be struck by lightning.

Hi!  I'm fine.  You look fine also.

Mr. Carpainter was pretty strange.  But so was everyone else.



(I'm just a plain ol' cow,  but Mr. Carpainter's messages always mooove me.)

(I have moooore respect for Mr. Carpainter than others.
Even if I become someone's steak dinner, I'll still respect him.)

(The blue cow thing wasn't such a great idea after all, huh.)

(You got mooooved here because you gave Mr. Carpainter some lip.)

(Moo!)



Cows and carrots?...
That's a nutty combination!



Excuse me, tourist.
I'm collecting donations to help protect the world from contaminants.
Donate whatever you can.Yes   No 
I'll be your shadow, then.

Finally, I have a chance to apologize.

How much would you like to donate?    $
Your good deed will be rewarded.  Here's a postcard for you.
Go and be happy!
I wanted to give you a postcard.  But... you can't accept it.
You have too many items.

I'll be your shadow, then.

Incredible!
I can't believe people exist who have no money at all...

There's a place ahead that can't be painted blue.
It's a strange and anti-blue place.
I can't stop thinking about it... and I can't even go near that place.

What was the anti-blue place like?
Was it scary? Yes No 
You seem to thrive in places like that.

I'm a changed person.  I'm no longer a believer in Happy-happyism.
Anyway, I'm very curious about the place that lies ahead of here.

Did you see a huge mole, like I've heard lives there?

You seem to thrive in places like that.



I heard many footprints exist deep down in the east cave.
People call that place Lilliput Steps, and it makes them feel uneasy.



Mr. Carpainter wants a girl.
No, I don't mean it like that.
I meant he's looking for a girl who can be the high priestess of Happy-happyism.
I heard he's already got her.

I apologize.



Psss psss Psss psss
That overweight kid helped me.  We kidnapped .
You know, she's hidden in a mountain cabin.
Oh, oh!  Now I've done it!
I thought you were one of us!  You know I was joking!
Ha ha ha!... Just forget about this...

You really think I was a bad boy?

I won't tell you anything.



Hey , it's been a long time.
Since we last met, the whole town has woken up.
The best happiness comes from being free... you kids made me realize that.



(I am not your enemy.
I am just a plain ol' mole.
You are certainly stronger than you were while wandering around Onett.
Have you ever suddenly gotten the  message when you met a weak enemy?
That's sure-fire proof that you've become stronger.
You don't want to waste your time fighting wimpy enemies, do you?)



(Peaceful Rest Valley ahead.  Proceed through cave.)

I had a dream that a boy named  was my destiny.
I know it's hard to believe.
Therefore, I knew you would rescue me.
If you didn't come, I would have had to try to bust out of here.
You can't open the door.
You'll have to get the key from Carpainter.  He's got it hidden away.
I heard Carpainter can control lightning.
In that case, you should wear this , okay?
I'll wait here until you return.
Come back here and get me out once you defeat Carpainter.
Don't worry about me, just kick butt like I know you can!

Are you hurt? Yes  No 
I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you.

I wonder who made the bridge impassable?
Why would someone do this?  Crud...



Humm dee dum dum dum.  I'm hunting for mushrooms!
Hey!  Would you be willing to sell that mushroom on your head for $50?
Ohhh...  It's your special mushroom.

I'm going to collect a ton!
Yes No 

Thank you.  Such a great mushroom.  I'm so happy I got it.

Ohhh...  It's your special mushroom.



Blue, blue...
Oops!  I won't say it again.
I fixed the bridge as a sign of apology.  I'm just trying to help.

Is that ?  You're always so cheerful!
Thanks for the help the other day.



(I'm not an enemy.
I'm just a regular mole.
Would you like to know about how to survive battles?)Yes  No 
(Well, you seem to know a lot already, even if you don't look like it.)

(You may  have noticed that, when you have been badly hurt in battle, you may survive a mortal attack and still have 1 HP.  If this has happened, it was because of your Guts.  Your survival may depend on your Guts level.
Also, more Guts helps you get more SMAAAAASHing hits.
Beyond Guts, you should have noticed that it takes some time for damage to be taken from you.
This is because of the rolling action of your HP meter.  Oops!  I mean your life.
If an enemy deals mortal damage to you, but you defeat all enemies before your life is gone, you survive.  This is all I know.)

(Well, you  seem to know a lot already, even if you don't look like it.)

This is the second  location.  But it's mine now.

How can we defeat the zombies?  ...Oh... Uh... I just don't know!

Since the  tunnel was cleared, many cars have started driving through it.
It's incredibly noisy.

The monsters are no longer in the tunnel!

Just imagine... when we wake up tomorrow morning...
Ugh! *shiver* It'll be really gross.

We should  try Zombie Paper or some kind of trap.  We have to do something!



Why don't we get all the zombies in this tent and then set it on fire?
We may all get munched before we have a chance to do anything...

It became really quite peaceful compared to before.

Hey!  Stupid zombies!  Come out, come out wherever you are!
The suspense is killing me...

Maybe a  good idea would be to try to get all the zombies into a single spot.



I'm glad you're going to help us, but you're pretty young.

Actually, I'm kind of glad I got to see real zombies.

Now you can go through the tunnel anytime you want!

Here, zombie, zombie, zombie...  I have a nice bone for you...

Well, we'll give it a try.  It's better than nothing, I guess.



The zombies are slowly advancing toward the tent.
Everyone, I repeat--the zombies are on the move!

I didn't like fighting the zombies, but those days were never dull!

That round flying object... a kid with glasses was on board.
The craft landed near the graveyard, right?
Can you fix it? Yes  No 
It was heavily damaged, though, right?

Hey, hey, hey! ...stupid zombies... come on over!

So you're going to use this tent as a trap...

So, this  weird object was flying around and crashed in the graveyard...
It looked like it was straight out of a Saturday morning cartoon!
Wow!  Did you come here in that flying contraption?

It was heavily damaged, though, right?

It's such a waste, but we can't do much about it...



I'll blame you for the rest of my 



I'll blame you after my 



You're the enemy of all zombies!
You monster!



If I try to get away, my body will just fall apart.
It's because I'm a zombie...



Could... you... help me?  ...Maybe not.



You humans are such cowards!



*Gasp* *Gasp*



I don't care if I pass away...
Ha!  I'm dead already!



Frankly, I'm running scared.
I don't mean that I actually run around.  I just mean I am frightened.
Conditions in the town are getting worse.

You made our lives peaceful.  I can sleep again.
It's like you used a bunch of  right?  Ha ha ha.

Zombie Paper really works, so I hope someone comes up with

This guy at the pizza joint told me about a new product called 



People used to call me evil, but these zombies are much more scary.
I left my wife and kids at home to escape to this tent.
That's how scary the zombies are.

The town is at peace, but my wife and kids won't speak to me.
What's the problem?

Those zombies stuck to the floor...
I wonder if they could still get me.
I don't care what happens to anyone else, I just want to save my own skin!

You can do whatever you want-- just save my life.



We painted over all the damaged parts of the Sky Runner.
Now I wonder how you start this thing up?



I want you to stay, but if you can't ...so long!
Thanks for every little ol' thing.



I'm calling out to you who I've never met...
I'm calling our friend who we've never met...
!  !  We need your help!
I am  and I am with another friend, ...
We are trying to contact you...

I am , and I am with another friend, ...
We are trying to contact you...

Only you, though far away, can save us, ...
Please hear my call and begin heading south...

But you are our one and only hope!...





I can't see where the problem is from this vantage point.
I need to be in the front.

(Only  is able to fix the Sky Runner.)

Ah!  Here's the problem, and it's not too tough to fix.
Hang on for a second or two...
There!
That should do it!
Now, if  board, the Sky Runner will take  back to Winters.
With Dr. Andonuts' help, I can modify the machine to fly to Summers.
...If Dad, I mean Dr. Andonuts, is not available, I'll have to figure it out by myself.
Anyway, let's go back to the lab in Winters.

Welcome to the Threed Sunset Hotel.
            
                                                         



I came from Fourside by bus.
Buffalo?  Oh yeah, I saw lots.  It's awesome.



A girl in Fourside called me.
There is a really popular band there now.
I think they're called the 

I told you the wrong band name before.  I said 
The real name is 
My girlfriend corrected me...


  Are you going out?

Hold the town for our glory, and for the glory of our master!&gt;
  The weather for today is dark and gloomy.

  Oh, you got up early today.

  You're working hard, even though you're young.


The pride of the Threed publishing community, the Threed Journal, is back with a vengeance!
  Tunnel now open!&gt;


But Tessie Watching Society member forgets to put film in his camera!&gt;


Blackout hits popular department store in broad daylight&gt;



&lt; and company save Threed confirms chief of Zombie Relief Corps&gt;

This morning's Threed Journal headlines read like this...
Uhh, I made a mistake and brought the ThreedStar by accident...
Well, let me read it to you anyway...

Heh, heh, heh... yeah, right...


Human beings cannot use teleportation states university professor&gt;






Is this a good portent?&gt;

Here's an interesting advertisement in today's Threed Journal...

Threed Sunset Hotel&gt;
...Uhhh ...hey! ...this is our ad!

Here's today's Threed Journal!...
Uh... whoops... there is no edition today...



&lt; and friends made honorary citizens!&gt;

S... sir...?

The guest's newspapers that were delivered to the hotel today... are different than normal.
The paper is called the Zombie Herald...
I'm scared, but let me tell you what is in it...

Good Morning!!

Here's your copy of the Threed Journal.



A few days ago, the zombies got some kids at this hotel.
The boy had a red cap... or was it a blue cap?

The boy had a red cap...  Hey!  It was you!



Be careful while walking around outside, especially near the graveyard.

Especially near the graveyard, it's dangerous.
But now it's been cleaned up, so it's safe, just to let you know.





I'm stronger than a zombie, but a bunch of zombies ganged up on me.

If you would have taken me along to hunt zombies or something,
I would have been a big help.





The zombies got me...
I should have gotten some zombie insurance.

I'm not afraid of no zombie.
When they come out, I'll beat them by myself.
Actually I don't want them to come out.  They're way too scary.













Hey, do you remember me?
I had to run all over to escape the zombies.
Now I can't remember where my house is...
I told you this before, remember?
Huh?  I never saw you before?
I guess I can't remember anything right.



Yeah, I worked for the zombies, but I betrayed them too.  I'm a con man, so I know the score.
Belch gives life to the zombies, but Belch works for Giygas, who I heard might be female.
Well, I'm not really sure whether Giygas is a male or a female.
I'm a helpful con man, don't you think?



I overheard the zombies whisper,

...Master Belch is the zombie leader.  He must be really pukey.

This town has completely changed from the first time you were here.
Can you feel the love?

Like I told you, there was a barfy bad guy named Belch.
Thank you for giving him the big flush.



That's right, there is a rumor that a monster called Belch is screwing up the town.
Belch!  That's a gross, twisted name even for a monster!

Isn't your  backpack worn out?  Oh, if only those straps could talk...

Buuuurp!
Oops... now I'll get  for a nickname.  Hee hee hee... uh... crud.



Zombies and ghosts are on the loose here.  Welcome to Threed.

Zombies and ghosts are not on the loose anymore.
Oh yeah, you guys got rid of the monsters.  Ooops!  He he.



Zombies and ghosts are on the loose here, so I can't get to Twoson or Fourside.
Maybe the hidden road in the graveyard is safe...

If you  weren't here, I might have had to be friendly with the zombies!

You guys got rid of the zombies,
'cept the ghosts in the tunnel seem scarier than ever!



This town seems very dark, right?
The people are mostly living at the center of town.
I wonder how we should get the town back from the zombies?

This town used to be dark, but thanks to you, now it's bright.



Hey, you don't look so happy, you'd better cheer up, or you'll become a zombie.
Some people have already become tools of the zombies.

I'm so glad you wiped out the zombies.  Let me give you a kiss.
*smooch*  Tee hee hee...  I'm blushing.



The headquarters of the Zombie Relief Corps is in the circus tent at the center of town.
We want to crush the zombies, except I think they'll crush us.

We won because of our brains, guts, and togetherness.
Wow!  What a rush!

I thought the zombies were gone...  But look at the surroundings...
It's still dark!



There's a rumor that there is an underground path at the edge of the graveyard that takes you somewhere.
When you get through the path, you'll meet a dirty, stinky, ugly, powerful monster.
I wet my pants just thinking about it.

You've been through some tough battles!


??  There's been a circus tent at the center of town for a long time.
I saw another tent to the south.  I wonder when it went up?

Visit Threed again!

That strange tent...  It was a monster!
I'm glad I didn't go inside!



I'm so scared of the zombies, I spend all of my time running from them.
I can't even get home!

I had to run all over to escape the zombies.
Now I can't remember where my house is...



(You're awfully kind taking time out to talk to a mouse.  This mouse loves you!)



Owoooo!



How can you smile like that in a dangerous place like this?

I thought there was something more to you than just your smile.



I saw a beat-up tour bus going to Fourside.  We can't go through the tunnel.
The band was really noisy, so the ghosts didn't approach the bus.
It must be great to be so happy-go-lucky, huh!

I wanted to
 catch one of the ghosts in the tunnel and keep it as a pet.
I'm just teasin'.  I can tease like that now that they're gone.



I'm only telling you this because you look like you're just passing through.
The truth is, I work for the monsters.
The humans seem to be losing, so I'm on the zombies' side for my own protection.
The zombies' leader likes Fly Honey.  He makes his followers collect it.
You know--bees make bee honey and flies make Fly Honey.
The zombie leader is strong because he always eats peanut butter and Fly Honey sandwiches...
I got lots of Fly Honey stored in the tent to the south.
I'll deliver it to the zombie leader soon.

...Since then, I've really matured.
I am doing well in the health food business.
People can get over any illness they might catch.
Don't you think it's a great business? Yes  No 
Okay... so it's not for you.

I heard that you beat the zombie leader after you got some important info from me.
Heh heh heh...
You should at least thank me... or how about a shoulder massage...
Why are you giving me such a dirty look, you brat!  Ptooie!

I could make you believe anything...

Okay... so it's not for you.



After the buses started running again,
I decided to come see my boyfriend... I really shouldn't have, though.



Wo!  Dude!  Like, my old girlfriend from Twoson hunted me down, man.
I'm totally bummed, 'cause I have another girlfriend here in Threed.



Ha ha ha ...check him out.
I think he's the bee's knees, oops, I mean way cool.  He used to be in a band.



(He stares into your soul.)



(He looks you over.)





Take a look at that chick in front of the hotel.
Regardless of some of the people I've seen her hanging out with,
I think I'd like to spend some time with her!



We did it!  Did you look in the tent?
Ya ha!  We taught those stupid zombies a lesson!



I was able to arrest  many zombies because of your help.
 sounds strange, doesn't it...



You might not understand my saying this, but, poor zombies...



Yuck!  We caught a lot of zombies!  Ugh! *shiver* It's really gross.



I saw a suspicious woman talking with the zombies around here.



Thank you for bringing peace and happiness back to Threed.  Thanks!
Peace!  Love!



I really didn't think those kids could have saved the town.
Who would have ever imagined it?



I won't forget you.
Won't you come back to Threed sometime?



Since the leader of the monsters is gone, the ghosts in the tunnel have disappeared.
The buses can get through the tunnel now.



I want to go through the desert and on to the big city.
I want to see the city,  and I want to smell like the big city.
I'm a real urban-type of guy.



From the bus stop at the hotel all the way to Fourside... is how much?  Do you remember?



Thank you!



You're heroes.  That rocks!



Sweet!



All righty!



I heard there is a guy who is digging for buried treasure in Dusty Dunes desert.
A share of that treasure  would be nice.

Hey!  I heard you got a share of the treasure found in the desert.
It didn't seem to change you at all, though.



I'm a detective from Twoson.
The statue called Mani Mani or something or other was stolen from the Happy-Happyism headquarters.
Do you have any clues for me? Yes  No 
Oh, I see...

Don't try to feed me your lies!

Oh, I see...



Finally, we can again breathe deep the outside air, now that the zombies are gone.
*SNORT* Ahhhh!  The outdoors is sooo refreshing!

I've lost the key to my house, so I can't get in.
No, no.  You don't need to look for it.  I'll look for it myself.

(It looks like the next bus will come pretty soon.)

Gyork Gyork!
Hey you, commoner!  You there wandering around without any ...
I am the mortal enemy of your kind.

You have defeated me...
Allow me to eat some Fly Honey for the last time...
Master Belch hates people like you.
...You see, those who don't have  are our mortal enemies...

Gyork!  Gyork!
Since you had  I considered you a friend.
But actually, you're just a commoner!  I am the mortal enemy of your kind.

I wanted to get your Fly Honey and gulp it down.
Master Belch and I love Fly Honey.  Gyorg Gyorg!...



Ah, , I just dreamt that you and I were taking a walk.
...What's wrong?



Oh,  and Tony.  You startled me.
Are you looking for a late night snack?
I'm having some trouble with my project.
If only 's father, Dr. Andonuts, were here.
He'd be able to provide a great deal of help.
I heard he's an astounding person.
He was the first leader of our Ultra Science Club...
I heard he's greater than Einstein or Heisenberg.
Rumor has it he's also very strange.
If you're heading to the locker room, take this key along.
It's a little bent though.
If you leave, call me, and I'll record your adventure.
It's like saving the game.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.

If you leave, call me, and I'll record your adventure.

Hah, ha, ha.  The key didn't work, did it?
I thought that might be the case.  So I just invented the...

Sorry for  the inconvenience.
If you are Dr. Andonut's son, you should be able to repair small tools and make them useful.
Just try to keep a positive attitude.

Seems like  you're trying to carry too much.  You aren't able to carry the key.
Hah, ha, ha.  What a greedy guy!  Hah, ha, ha.

However, you already have too many things to carry.

I heard a creature called Tessie lives in the southern lake...
I don't believe it!  I think someone made a model and placed it in the lake.



I heard a more interesting story than the rumor about Tessie.
It's about the Cave Boys at Stonehenge.
Many claim to have actually seen them.



I wonder if the rumor is true that the center of Stonehenge has an entrance leading someplace.
Some day, we should check it out.



I'm sleepy.
I'll wash my face, brush my teeth, do my business, and go to bed.



If you're going outside, stop by and say hi to Maxwell before you leave.
He always looks out for the younger students.
Maxwell is still working hard in the lab downstairs.
Anyway, these days there are many dangerous animals wandering around outside.



I'm so sleepy.  Tony's birthday party is tomorrow.
I hand decorated each cookie to pass out at the party tomorrow.

, I can't believe you could do something so nasty...





There's a monkey at the entrance.  Take the monkey.  He's really noisy.
If you buy a pack of bubble gum, you can have the monkey for free.
Otherwise, he will cost you a buck.  So, do you want him? Yes  No 
You absolutely, positively should buy him.  You know what I mean?

Sorry, the bubble gum is sold out.

Thanks!  The monkey's yours.

You absolutely, positively should buy him.  You know what I mean?

What?  You don't even have a buck?
Then, I'll let you have the monkey for free.
Here's a pack of bubble gum.  Don't forget to take the monkey.

Oh, oh, you can't carry anything else.
Why don't you return after you get rid of something.



The bubble gum here is incredible.
You should see the size of the bubbles I can blow!

Is it cold outside?



Kyee Kyee! (Yeah!)

Kyu Ukyee  (Gimme some gum.)
(The monkey got a piece of bubble gum from  and blew a bubble!)

(The Bubble Monkey joins you.)

I'm the cook for the Tessie-Watching club.
How about some stew? Yes  No 
You're full, aren't you?

No, no.  There's no need to pay me.

You're full, aren't you?



If I find Tessie, do you think I'll get in the newspaper?
I'm looking for my 15 minutes of fame...

Do you think Sebastian's kidnapping will be in tomorrow's paper?

Do you think my name will make it into the newspaper?



Mr. Brickroad, the dungeon maker referred you, right?
And not only that...  What?  Who?  My son?  Oh... I... can't... I can't believe it...
You're , my son.  It's been maybe 10 years since I last saw you.

How about a donut? Yes  No

Well, I was only offering...  I'd also like a donut right about now.

Oh, I see.
That girl named  must have sensed I was here.
Ok, I'll try to help you out.
I'm trying to make a Phase Distorter that can connect two points in space and time.
It's still incomplete.
I'll let you use another invention I call the Sky Runner.
It's a little bit old but it'll certainly help.

You'll get there for sure if you listen to the message.
The round machine over there is the Sky Runner.

The Bubble Monkey said there's a cave north of Stonehenge.
I've known about it for a long time.
The locals call the area  but I haven't been there.
I wonder what's inside the cave... I uh, huh...  I understand...
While you're checking out that place, I'll work on remodeling the Sky Runner.
Oh yes, yes.  My co-worker, Big Foot, dislikes violence.
He's such a nice guy, and he loves people.
He often shares his beef jerky with me...

A boy named Apple Kid called.
I don't know how he got the phone number...  He's sounds very smart.
Don't worry, he's on his way here.

Hmm...
...It looks like you found something out.
I finished remodeling the Sky Runner.
You can leave for Summers whenever you wish.
It shouldn't  break this time...  Well, maybe...



I've been waiting for you.
My master, Apple Kid completed this 
While he was calling you, he was kidnapped.  He felt like this...!!!!!
I was there, but was helpless.  Sorry about that.
Anyway, take this machine.

I've been taking care of this place while waiting for you.
I no longer need to stay, since you have arrived...
I'll leave for Saturn Valley as quiet as a mouse.

Way to go.

I think this is an important item.
Get rid of something you don't need, and come back for it.





Instant Revitalizing Device
(In only a few seconds, this machine fully revitalizes you, just like a good night's sleep.)



The tame animals have become wild.  Something evil is going on.

Outside there are many monsters I've never seen before...
I wonder what's happening.
You should stay here where it's safe.  We don't mind if you stay.



So, why don't you rest here for a short while...  Have something to drink, perhaps some tea? Yes  No 

Are you feeling much better now?  Good luck.

Are you feeling much better now?  Good luck.



!  Long time no see.  You've gotten taller...
Oh, I don't have time to chat right now.  Tony's missing.
I thought he was with you...  He suddenly disappeared.
He's usually very responsible and leaves a note at least...

What?  You're 's friends?
Good timing.
Tony, 's friend, suddenly disappeared.  I thought he left to go see ...
...There is a good probability that something is wrong.



You're right.
We're here at  waiting to see 
We're known as the ...

I'm so glad I finally saw it.
I'm so happy, it brings tears to my eyes and makes my nose run.
Boo hoo hoo. *snort* Boo hoo...

This is what we've been waiting for!  Finally... it's coming out!
...*fart* ...'scuse me...
Tessie is emerging!

I finally saw Tessie!
It's like seeing a UFO.
It emerged from the lake and flew toward Stonehenge.
...It kidnapped one of my friends along the way.



So, you've also been bitten by Tessie-mania.
You're in luck.
We may be able to see Tessie tomorrow.  I can't wait...

I waited for you.
I'm glad to see you again.
You're back, Sebastian.
...I just love making Haiku.

Maybe that whirlpool is...

Where are you, my friend?
They came and took you away.
Come back, Sebastian.
Hey, that's a Haiku poem!



Why, hello!  I wonder if there are any monkeys around!
Y'know, they say that Tessie is friendly with monkeys...

I can't believe that I was so brave...

What a cute little monkey.  Would you like a piece of gum?
Maybe monkeys don't like gum.



Ki-kye-kye-kye-kiii.
(Yep, I have some  cheeeewing gum!)

Kya ke ke kiya.  (In the monkey community,  is famous.
You're such a great man.)
            
                                                                        
                                                                        
   
            
                                                                        
                                                                        
   



Maybe it was too easy...?
My name's Brickroad, the dungeon developer.
I've devoted my life to making dungeons.
Well, by combining my skills and Dr. Andonuts intelligence,
I can become  the first combination of human and dungeon  in history.
Let's meet again once I have become dungeon man.
...Would you like to get a good night's rest? Yes  No 
You don't want to rest?

You don't want to rest?



You  don't look very bright.  Let me explain.
These stones are making a pattern.  It's called Stonehenge.
UFO's often visit here.
You must have seen it on TV or read about it in the tabloids.
Yes, THAT Stonehenge.



Okay, now use me as a step and climb over the gate. 
Well... I'll say goodbye for now.
I don't know where you're going or why, but remember, we are best friends forever.



I heard that the wind is always blowing when Tessie appears.
Ahh Choo!
I feel like I'm catching a cold.

Sebastian, chum, was kidnapped!

I wonder what Tessie thinks of me?



Tessie may unexpectedly be living in the woods.
I personally think so.

...It's so shocking...  He was such a great guy...

Tessie appeared again today and smiled at me.



Kyi kya kiko kree.
(I saw you once before just for a second...  You know my fiancee.)
Koo kya keke  (My fiancee loves to chew gum.
He went to visit Dr. Andonuts' lab... but he hasn't returned yet.)
Kye koko kikkya kekra,  (I want to go there so I can get him home, but without him, I can't cross Lake Tess.)
Kri kekko kya ko
(I'm really worried that the mad doctor will use him in a crash test.)

Kyakkro ki kyokke  (Ah, , my husband has been returning home late these days.  He says he's busy.)
Kya.
(I know he's out saving the earth, but a marriage is also important.)

Ku kyo kika.
(It's me again, that chewing gum monkey's wife.)
Kako kyuka kre.
(My husband left me here to go play with Tessie along the shores of Lake Tess.)



 just called.  He's with Dr. Andonuts.
The two of them may be able to develop a new scientific theory.
You've helped make a beautiful life for everyone...



... doesn't call me.
Maybe he thinks I'm too annoying...
But I don't think so.
, did you tell him not to call me?
...No, I know you wouldn't do that.
If you see , please, please ask him to call Tony.  Thanks!



(This dungeon has no entrance fee.
Come on in!)



Next *Bloop*  Next *Bloop*  Room...



I expected there to be about a seven percent chance that you would rescue me.
I just thought it was a good opportunity to meet Mr. Saturn.
I also got to meet Dr. Andonuts...  See you.
What?
You're looking for the book ?
I returned it to the Onett library.
Please use the book to help the shy Tenda tribe.
...Anyway, because I knew you, I had an incredible experience... wow!
I was kidnapped by some of Giygas' toadies!



Kay-o.  Can breathe...
*Bloop* *Bloop* *Bloop*  Oh, no!



Kidnapped.  Happy.
Rescued.

I give you ribbon.

Too much.
...can't carry all.



Oh, no... *Bloop* *Glub*  Can't see anything...
*Bloop* *Glub*  !... *Bloop*...
Where... is... ...  *Bloop*



,  buddy!
Oh me, oh my...
You... came to rescue me!  Pal!

Where's ?
, you've altered 's destiny.
Bring back !
Bring back my friendship with !!  !

...Oh, ?
...Oh, ?

I'm Tony.
I'm 's best friend.  I've known him for the longest time.

I'm 's best friend.  I've known him for the longest time.



I was scared, but I knew I'd be saved if I courageously just sat here and waited long enough...
That's what I thought, but I began to lose hope...
I'm so glad you saved me after all.



I was kidnapped while milkin' a cow on m' farm.
I didn't think they'd git a ransom by kidnappin' little ol' me.



This is the happiest moment of my life.
No matter what happens I will live, live, live ten thousand years.
Thanks for all that you've done.



Since our imprisonment is now over,
I want to start on the Phase Distorter as soon as possible.
...Oh, I almost forgot to thank you.
Thank you.
Don't worry about us.  You've got important things to do...



*Glub* ...can't breathe...



*Bloop* *Glub*  Can't... last... much... longer...

(For some reason, the iron eraser statue disappeared in an instant!)

You're much stronger *whirrr* than our intelligence indicated...
We were not *beep* prepared for that eventuality...
The Prophecy from the *click* Apple of Enlightenment may be true... but you must not *whirrr* underestimate us.

When you  defeated the Starman DX, the Stonehenge base ceased functioning.



(Please take my son along.
He may look like a regular, small mouse, but he can lead you to an exit if you're lost in a maze.)
(Will you take one of my sons along?)Yes   No 
(He's a tough boy.  You can treat him as one of your items.)

(He's a tough boy.  You can treat him as one of your items.)



You finally got here.
This is the fourth  location.  But it's mine now.
Take it from me, if you dare...















Welcome to my modest dungeon!
      ...Brick Road



Watch for falling materials!
      ...Brick Road



Way to go.  Please come back again.
      ...Brick Road



Did you bring some ?
It's Master Belch's favorite.Yes  No 
Then, why are you here?!

You didn't bring it?  You seem kind of suspicious to me...
You cannot pass through here!

Then, why are you here?!

Ok, you may pass through.
Hey, be careful!  Be sure you don't drop it!



Urp!
...It's hard to make the gross sounds that Master Belch does.
I know I can't do it.



Master Belch is the slimiest!
However, I heard he's also serving some Giygas guy.  That I cannot believe.



Aren't you the Fly Honey delivery boy?  What's the password!
It doesn't mean I don't trust you.  Just say it!
Say it now!
Someone so quiet is either extremely shy or extremely dangerous...
What a suspicious fellow!



So, you're the ones who destroyed the zombies that I assigned to Threed!!



Tired.
But so good.  Ding!



Ah!  Soooo...  Honest!
Smile.  Boing!



Buuurp!
So you are ?
...I see...  Gyork!  Gyork!  Gyork!
There's a prophecy that a boy will destroy Master Giygas.
Heeg!  Heeg!  Heeg!  You make me laugh so hard...
If Master Giygas is scared of someone... he would have to be worse than the greatest evil...
Garg!  Ga!  Garg!  Ga!  Ga!  Ga!
I'll take you down big time, so get ready for the worst fight of your life!
Gha Gha Gha!  Get ready to feel the pain of true nausea!
Ghe Ghe!  Come on, let's go!
Looks like it was an even fight...  Buurp!
But, Master Giygas has managed to get the Mani Mani statue into Fourside.
The city will soon be in worse condition than living in your own puke!
Suffer, spanky!  Gha, Gha, Gha, Gha, Gha!
Buuuurp!

...No?...  Gyork, Gyork, Gyork!

Ah, .
The Phase Distorter will certainly be completed someday, in my humble opinion.

The chance  of Giygas gaining victory with his monstrous plan is 99%.
However, your courage has produced a 1% chance that Giygas fails.
I must try to come to a deeper understanding of this trait called

Excellent, excellent!  Everything proceeded as planned.
Dr. Andonuts, Mr. Saturn and I worked together and finally completed the Phase Distorter.
The purpose of the device is to enable instantaneous travel through space and time.
In this prototype, you can only travel to different points within the same time period.
It is able, however, to search out the locations of enemies.
Right now, it is indicating the presence of enemies in the Lost Underworld!



Yahah!  The Mr. Saturns are incredible folk.
And the Apple Kid...  He is a most exceptional young man, very different from other kids.
...Well, anyway...  The prototype Phase Distorter has been stolen.
Someone resembling a pig wearing clothes took Mr. Saturn captive and stole the device!

It's a miracle!
A miracle that has only happened because of your great courage!
...Believe me, I went through a lifetime's worth of stress while you were gone...
I just wish I could have come with you as a robot.
I should have used the Phase Distorter.
What a story that would have been...
  Wah ha ha ha ha!

Good.  At last, the time has come.
Are you ready? Yes No 
Remember, the Phase Distorter, version 2, is equipped with two new features.
First, it can repair your biological functions.
Second, it can save your progress.

You might not be able to return.  So, make sure you are optimally outfitted.
Are you ready to go? Yes No 
Even if you're not 100%, perfectly, completely ready...
Well, you should be as prepared as possible.  It would be for the best.
Without careful preparation, you would be in big trouble.
I just want to make sure you're ready.
Let me know when your preparations are complete.

Hmmmm...
If I only had a piece of a meteorite,
I might be able to extract some Zexonyte.

Leave everything to us, and you get some rest.
This is getting most fascinating!



Ah, yes!  This is fantastic!  What?

The Apple Kid was lost, and he was just wandering around, so I brought him here.
That was quite a while ago...  Would you like some tea? 
Ah, I see that you're busy.
It looks like things are pretty rough.  You take care now...

Incredible!  Excellent!
I'm not quite sure what for, but congratulations on a job well done!
If we ever have the chance to get together again, let's go on a picnic or something.
Maybe we could play horseshoes, too!

I'm not  sure what will happen, but I sense big-time trouble ahead for you.
I'm going to stay here for a while and help Mr. Saturn.
It's important for a man to enjoy doing his duty.

 opened the present.











We are also running an inn, mister.
It's $ a night if you want to stay here.
Do you want to stay?
That's probably for the best.
You see... our beds are really old and dusty.

When you travel though the desert, you may be hit by sunstroke.
If you see flashing lights before your eyes, you may have sunstroke!
But don't worry too much.
If you have a Wet towel, you'll be all right.

Well, have a good rest.  You'll wake up refreshed!

That's probably for the best.
You see... our beds are really old and dusty.

You... don't have enough money.





It's a small house, but please stay the night.

Here, I'll give you this now... for sure.

Come on!  You haven't got room again!
Please take care of it right away.



This traffic jam is taking forever.
...Man, do I need to go...



I heard that a little ways ahead a herd of buffalo is running across the road.
I can't move an inch!



I feel sorry for the guys behind me, but I'm so bent,
I'm leaving my car here and walking instead!



I was going to see my girlfriend in Fourside...
At this pace I'll be 100 years old by the time I get there!



We sleep in the desert, so we're often mistaken for corpses.
But a corpse doesn't usually wear a bathing suit, right?
...Hey, stop staring at my tan lines... Go away.



Annoying kids...  What a group of brats!...
Scat you little monsters!



This hole's great!  Good hole, good hole, good hole...
First, someone asked me to dig for buried gold.
I began to feel like I was obligated to find it.
Man, am I starving.
Do you have any food you can spare?
The humanitarian thing is to help people out when they're hungry.
Although I hate it,  would work for me...
Seems like you have a lot of stuff.
What are you gonna give me?
Thank you.  If I find the gold, I'll give it to you.

If we could just find a diamond even...
It's a shame that a digger like me can't find buried gold.
I'll try even harder.

You've gotten rid of the monster?!
Good job.
Ok, from here on, just let me dig...  You'll see, I'll find the buried gold!
Before I start digging I'm going to set a careful plan of action...

I'm still  hard at work digging and digging.  Hey, wait a second.
You've gotten rid
 of the monster?!
Good job.
Ok, from here on, just let me dig...  You'll see, I'll find the buried gold!
Before I start digging I'm going to set a careful plan of action...

Come on!  I can't eat this!



I've been watching them dig for a while...  I wonder what they'll find.

They only found a diamond... well, you take what you get...



If they have a live broadcast from the dig,
I can check out the dig while relaxing on the floor.



I think he should dig somewhere else.



I have lots of work to do, but I can't seem to move.
I'm so curious about the dig.  I can't help it.



I'm big brother Pancho.



I'm kid brother Pincho.



I'm Tomas Jefferson.



As sea monkeys live in the sea... desert monkeys live in the dessert.
I mean desert, not dessert!
I am happy that there are animals in the desert, aren't you?





! Greetings!
I'm George, Gerardo Montague's brother.
Gerardo is in his mine, but he hasn't found any buried treasure yet.
We did, however, find a Diamond instead.
Gerardo told me to give it to .
Here it is... please take it.
Well, I've got to go...
I'm busy working at the other mine... busy, busy, busy!

Greetings, !...  Well, greetings to you since  isn't here...

I think I have a bleeding ulcer from worrying too much.
I'm helpless to really do anything.



I'm one of the masters of this hole.
There are five masters in all.  We are all moles, of course.
I believe I'm the third strongest amongst us.
Take your best shot!

Ha ha ha.
You've fought the strongest master of this hole, the second strongest master of this hole, the fourth strongest master of this hole, and the weakest master of this hole!
I'm truly the third strongest master of this hole.
Now you see the true advantage of being third!

I'm truly the third strongest master of this hole.
I'll demonstrate the power of being third to you!

My strength falls between the second and fourth strongest masters.
Do you wanna test me?

I'm really the third strongest master.
I'll destroy you now!







(Please take my son along.
He may look like a regular, small mouse, but he can lead you to an exit if you're lost in a maze.)
(Will you take one of my sons along?)Yes  No 
(He's a tough boy.  You can treat him as one of your items.)

So, you're a Runaway Five fan, huh?
What?
Excuse me?
No, no!
This band owes me a million bucks.
If they break their contract, they'll be in deep doodoo with the police.
The police would probably say,  or something like that...
Unless you're able to pay a million dollars on their behalf?
You'd have to find buried gold, or you would never be able to pay such a huge sum of money.
Ho ho ho...
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!

Ok?  Don't forget.
Life is money.
I've lived that life.
You can buy everything but   and 

(Thump, thump!...  thump, thump!
I made so much money, I can hear my heartbeat!)



Yaaaieeee!!
That that that ... you're going to pay with that ?!
O... o... okay, th... that's fine.  I'll rip up this contract.
*rrrrrip!*
Don't tell anyone about the ...
Now the Runaway Five are free!
...You should thank me.
That  is worth maybe...  MAYBE... $50.
So I gave you a bargain.
(Thump, thump...  Thump, thump!
I made lots of money...)

What, what, what?
I can't tell what it is from this distance.
Bring it closer!
            
          
Sorry about bein' such troublemakers!           
We won't be  so gullible anymore...  Well, our fans are waitin', baby...       
Let's just do this one last show and then get outta here...              
All right!  Thanks again!         
Money, that's what I want.  Money, that's what is hot.  Money, that's what I want.
Money, it's what we ain't got 'cept freedom, freedom, freedom is what we've really sought!     
Money, that's what I want.  Money, that's what is hot.  Money, that's what I want...         



Hey, kid...
This is a restricted area.
Back stage is right behind this door.

Ah, you're a friend of the Runaway Five?
Did you come to see Miss Venus?  Come inside quickly.
Don't let the other fans see you enter.

If  arrives, the Runaway Five told me to let him in.

Ah, you're a friend of the Runaway Five...

Don't let the other fans see you enter.

When  arrives, the Runaway Five told me to let him in.
So please come in.



Oh, you're just a little kid.
I'm too busy right now to give you my autograph.
Maybe next time, little man.

Looks like you aren't too busy.  Make yourself at home for a while.

Oh, you again...
Look, I'm busy right now.
I'll give you an autograph next time.
Are you here to see my show? Yes No 
...Oh, I see.
Looks like you aren't too busy.  Make yourself at home for a while.

Oh, you want an autograph?
Okay, I'll give you my autograph on this banana peel...
Here you go.
Oh, and this is a bonus...
Smack! girl.

...Then, you should give me a big hand.

Okay.
...Then, you should give me a big hand.

...Oh, I see.
Looks like you aren't too busy.  Make yourself at home for a while.

Oh, uh huh...
I can't give you the banana 'cause you have too much stuff.



Oh, you're just a little kid.
I'm too busy right now to give you my autograph.
Maybe next time, little man.



Again, we've been cheated by the theater owner.
We're stuck here with a phony contract.  Oh yeah!



We know how to sing but we don't know how to handle money or women.
Do-wap, do do wop.



We owe you guys so much.
Sorry.



We're so helpless.
Really helpless, and hopeless...  Hyuk hyuk hyuk.



To meet Geldegarde Monotoli, you'll need our help.
I don't exactly know why... it's just a hunch.



Do you wanna buy a ticket? Yes No 
Please come again.

30 bucks, please.Yes No 
Thanks a lot.

Please come again.

Thanks a lot.

Excuse me , but your hands are full...

I'm sorry sir...
We don't just give away the tickets... you must pay 30 dollars.



Please have your tickets ready...

Are you enjoying yourself?

Please have your tickets ready...

Boys and girls, ladies and gents... this is a very special show, the final Runaway Five show here at the Topolla!
Please, please, please don't miss this once in a lifetime chance to see their show.

Oh, hi.

No kidding...

Thanks a lot.
Please hurry.  The show will be starting at any moment.



No kidding...



Thanks a lot.
Please hurry.  The show will be starting at any moment.



I heard Venus made an appearance at the Runaway Five show.
I missed her 'cause I went to the bathroom.
I'll hate bathrooms for the rest of my life.



Oh, I can't see the Runaway Five here anymore...?
I should dump this sorry excuse of a man and become a Runaway Five groupie.





Bread in this town has a very plain, nondescript flavor to it.
To tell you the truth, I'm the owner of this bakery.



I was thinking 



What?
You came to deliver my grandma's momento, the ?!
Thank you.
Thank you sooooo much!
It's our family tradition to keep things forever.
...Okay, I'll give you something as a reward.
Here's my socks that I use only for special occasions.
I've worn these socks for just five years.
There are no holes, and they've only been worn once since the last washing.
They stink a little... but they're still good.
Hey, don't refuse me here... I'm being generous!
Please take good care of my socks... *sniff!*

It goes directly to the 47th floor.
Quit staring at my hips... why don't you stand somewhere else instead of behind me?

Just kidding.
Last night there was a solitaire tournament.

I'll invite you next time.
Hey, wait...  Do you even know what solitaire is?

I'm an elite businessman who works in Mr. Monotoli's office.

It sounds like your lifestyle
...isn't something I'd be that proud of!

I hope my salary stays the same.
You don't understand.
This is a huge concern of elite businessmen like me.



Hello, baby face.
What brings you to the Monotoli Building?

Hello, baby face.
What brings you to the Enrich Flavor Building?



Oh, ,
...
I'm Geldegarde Monotoli.
Don't you remember me?
I returned this building to Mr. Enrich Flavor.
Now I'm working as an elevator man.
I'm very happy, and it's good to be alive.

Are you a friend of Master Pokey?
It's okay to visit him here, but don't wander around the building.
Someone might be suspicious of you and take a pot shot at you with a machine gun...

A lot has happened to me.
I have to try and sort it all out... thinking is tough for me.



Whoops...
I was almost gonna beat you up.

When I'm  off duty from my body guard job, I still have a lot of pent-up energy.
But don't worry, I won't come after you.
Unless you're kinda itchin' for a fight...



This elevator is going down.
Look, don't stand behind me and stare at my hips!

Ground floor.

You must never show your face around Master Pokey.  You got that?



Get away from me, kid!



You won't get away from me, kid!



You haven't changed much, .
Have I met you before?
You're just annoying kids to me...
I'm Aloysius Minch, Pokey's dad.
Due to my son's success, I now live the life of a rich man.

I'll take you to Mr. Monotoli's office on the 48th floor.
Only you may go.

Your Trout-flavored yogurt, .
Master Pokey's cool!
He gave me something the other day, and said 

Are you a friend of the Runaway Five?
Would an autograph be asking for too much? Yes No 
I don't mean your autograph, silly.

Thanks for dropping by, even though there's nothing to do, honey.

I'm sorry I've created so much trouble for you.

I'll tell you everything.
The Mani Mani Statue creates an illusion.
It attracts evil spirits and weakens your heart.

Anyway, the evil side would be in trouble if you visit Summers...
Oh!  On the contrary, you should definitely go to Summers, especially because they don't want you to make it there.

...Would you like to hear the whole story again? Yes No 
Summers is located across the ocean.  Take my helicopter.
I'll open the door to my heliport.
You must go on!

This is your destiny.

You've brought the town of Fourside back to life.
I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart.
Thank you.

Welcome to the Monotoli Grand Hotel.

Welcome to the Enrich Grand Hotel.



, ...
Are you staying here tonight?
Thanks for being so generous with your tips...
...You never gave me a tip?... never mind...



Hey, you!...
If you meet a beautiful, seductive woman who's looking for me, tell her 
...Anyway, I don't think a woman like that would be looking for me...








Then on page 17, 



And on page 23 of the Fourside Post.

Good morning!
This is a unique service, exclusive to our hotel only!
I'm here to read you today's headline.

What?
Does Mr. Geldegarde Monotoli come here often?
Hello!  Time to get up!!
It could never happen!...  Well, actually that's not true.

Sorry about the other day.
This sidewalk cafe isn't as profitable as it used to be.
This is just a hangout for the regulars.



Kids shouldn't be drinking espresso!
You shouldn't be hanging around here.
What?
Mr. Monotoli's here?
You got that wrong, kid!

Good evening, hero!  How about an espresso?



There's a loud noise outside.
Must be the seventh inning stretch, and the fans are singing  at the stadium.

Kids shouldn't drink espresso.  It'll stunt your growth, stubby!
And quit hanging out around here.
What?
Mr. Monotoli's here?
You must be thinking of someone else!



I'm surprised you talked to an ordinary guy like me.
I have no information or items to help you out.
Don't you think it's natural for a guy like me to be here?!
I enjoy the atmosphere here.
By the way, let me quiz you.
There are 5 apples.
If you eat one, how many are left?
5 minus 1 is 4... so 4's left.
...Ah, it's not funny?  Okay, here's another one...
Master Pokey's maid Electra is  to order...
...Oh, puns aren't funny either...

Hey, long time no see!
I've thought of a new joke since before...
Knock, knock!... (who's there?)
Sawyer... (Sawyer who?)
Sawyer doin' well, I'm fine, too!
Baaa ha ha ha!...
...You don't think it's funny?
I really thought this would be funny to you.
Now my self confidence is TOTALLY shot!  Back to therapy...

I've been trying to think of some funny jokes...
I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream!
Waaa ha ha ha ha ha.  That's so funny!
That should really make you laugh.
C'mon, laugh!
If you hear any funny jokes, be sure you let loose and laugh...
Please... I'm counting on you to laugh!
*boo hoo hoo*...



I was in the middle of a caffeine buzz, and I had to get to the bathroom fast!
When I got there,
I accidentally knocked on the wall instead of the restroom door...
The next thing I knew, someone asked  and really surprised me!
Maybe I just imagined it?...

The hint that I gave you was critical to helping you win...
Happy happy!
We rock!  Ha ha ha.



I used to be Monotoli's employer.
Then I realized his schemes made my company go bankrupt.
My house and land were taken away...
Now I'm homeless...
Monotoli didn't used to be so powerful.
I want to find out his secrets, so I'm spending my time here, watching to see if he ever drops in.

I wanna say thanks.
Monotoli destroyed my life... but I've decided not to blame anyone.
I'm having a wonderful time each and every day now.
Thank you, thank you!



Wheeee!  Hic!
.
Pokey left me, his own dad, and just disappeared.
If you see him, tell him that he should take better care of his father.
Don't tell my wife in Onett that I've been spending my time here.
Hic!  Wheeeee!



Seems like it's just for decoration.



(You were wandering around the warehouse with a vacant, far away look in your eyes.
Were you daydreaming?)

I'm lucky I'm a rat.  We have such easy lives...



(The Mani Mani statue was actually a device that created illusions.
The illusion device was destroyed.)



The Dinosaur Museum doesn't have any real dinosaurs...  They're all replicas.
I'm sure everyone knows that.
If you still want to go see the dinosaurs, pay 5 dollars apiece for the entrance fee.  Is that okay? Yes No 
Maybe you think  dollars is too much.
Or are you just not interested in dinosaurs.  You're strange, kid!

You don't even have  dollars!
You don't deserve to go in the museum.



I'm so happy there are some visitors today.  These days, few people come here.
...I'm Mr. Spoon, the academic researcher.
I wonder if there are any famous stars here today?
Dinosaurs...
Huge, aren't they?  Well, that's all I've gotten out of my research!
You wanna hear more?
(Whispering) To tell you the truth...
I heard that dinosaurs were found near the lower side of Scaraba, and there were lots of them.
There are unconfirmed reports that the dinosaurs ate some of the natives there.
If you go, please try to find the dinosaurs and bring back photographs.

Please come back again to study,
'cause I don't like being alone...

You want to know about something ?
.....
Hmmmm...
...You know, there's a new singer named Venus at the Topolla Theater.
Could you bring me her autograph on an eraser?
Then, I'll show you something 
...Oh, if you can get her autograph on anything, don't worry about the eraser...
I don't care if the autograph is written on toilet paper...



You got it!
That banana peel has an authentic  autograph?
Yep, there's no doubt about it!
Now for my promise.
I'll tell you about something 
In the next room, there is a light shining from far, far below the manhole.
There, I found a huge, monster rat!
I'm not trying to pull your leg...
I'll let you go there and check it out for yourself.

As I thought, dinosaurs did actually exist in history.
Yes, I have sure-fire proof.
I've seen them in so many movies, they must have been real!

I'm just enjoying being with my grandchildren.
I'll be better soon.
Do you have grandchildren? Yes No 
Yes, yes... you seem  a little young for that...

Oh?
At your age?
Oh... the youth of today shock me...
My lands...

Yes, yes... you seem  a little young for that...



Grandma's gonna get better, huh.





Would you like to buy tickets for the Topolla Theater? Yes No 
Oh, I see.
You're not a customer.

Orchestra seats and balcony seats are sold out.
Now, there's  left.  It's $30 per person.
Is that okay with you? Yes No 
Thanks a lot.  Enjoy the show.

Oh, I see.
You're not a customer.

Thanks a lot.  Enjoy the show.

Sorry, but you can't carry all of these...

I've never heard of anyone who doesn't even have $30!
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho.
Oh, excuse me for my laughing in your face.







Everything's so expensive...  Should I return to my hometown?

What did you do during the power outage?
I was sitting here 'cause I was scared.







Mumble, mumble, mumble... man, I'm so busy.
Don't bother me, kid.

I want to get out of here, because they suddenly shut down the store and the power goes out.
There are lots of strange things happening in this department store.



Oh, so you're skipping school too, right?

I heard a sound like  and it was loud.
I wonder if someone was fighting.



When I grow up, I wanna work for APE as a programmer...
Do you have any connections with those guys? Yes No 
Oh, you didn't have to answer.
It was dumb of me to ask you that question.

The power supply to the game was cut off.  I wasted my money.

Oh, you didn't have to answer.
It was dumb of me to ask you that question.



I wanna save up some money and go to Summers or somewhere else to relax.

Certainly, it's very dangerous living in the city.



(Somehow, I feel like the lights will get turned off in the department store.
I guess it's just a mouse's sixth sense...)

(Somehow, I
 felt like the lights would get turned off in the department store.
I guess it's just a mouse's sixth sense...)

(Hey you!
I've got this eerie feeling... like there's a ghost walking along with you...)

(Somehow, I
 feel like the lights will get turned off in the department store.
I guess it's just a mouse's sixth sense...)











Gwaaagh, Gwarrrgh!.
You finally made it.
This department store is gonna be your grave!  Gwaaagh.
You will be gone, and you'll be burning in...
Well, you'll go to heaven!
...Even though you could beat me...
Master Giygas will avenge me...
At this moment,  should be...Monotoli...
Gwaaaaarrrrgh!!



The city of Fourside has developed quite a bit since Mr. Geldegarde Monotoli hit the big time.  It's been good for the city.

In the future, you will build cities and even create a country...
...I'm counting on you.

That Mr. Monotoli has lost quite a bit of his resources...



I've heard some bad rumors about Mr. Monotoli.
I heard he made a deal with a pure evil entity in exchange for power... you know... stuff like that.

My grandpa  told me that everyone has at least one outstanding skill.
When I look at you, I know he's right.

Just as I thought, Monotoli has a portion of Evil's power.



In the old days, Mr. Monotoli was just a regular, unattractive real estate agent.
Now he has the power to control the police force.
I don't think the city of Fourside is better than before.

You're very young, but you brought something very precious back to the people in this town.
Thank you.



The Runaway Five from Twoson seem very popular.
I heard that the Topolla Theater is always full.

I heard you're friends of the Runaway Five.  I'm jealous.



Speaking of the Topolla Theater, there's a new singer called Venus.
She's better than the Runaway Five.
I'm totally bonkers about her...

Venus...
She's become even more beautiful.



I don't get it.
I heard that a guy who looks like Monotoli has been hanging out at Jackie's Cafe.
You know, the totally unpopular place.
I heard he quietly goes in and out.

You boys are young, but you did a great job here and out there.

Jackie's Cafe was where the deal with the evil entity took place.
I can't believe it... can you?



No one know anything.  Grrrr.
Monotoli's toadies stole everything from me, including my house and land.
Weep, weep...
They are evil incarnate.
Lawyers, policemen, everyone that follows Monotoli!
They're all his toadies!
No matter how you fight him, you can't win!
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay... just leave me here to cry into my cappucino!
Nosy!

Hic!
I'm fine.
Hic!
I'm not drinking the... hic!
I hate these hiccups...
Yes, they're... hic!
Another cappucino here!
Hic!



Protect Mr. Monotoli first.
The safety of the citizens of this city comes second.
Heh heh heh.  That's our job, you know.
Heh heh.

You're getting in better shape every time I see you.
Don't you wanna be a police officer?

It was stupid of me to let Monotoli do whatever he wanted.
We'll do our best to create an environment in which people can live safely.



You boys are sneaking around, looking for Mr. Monotoli, aren't you?
If I catch you boys doing anything, I'll arrest you--no questions asked!
Be prepared!
Got it, ...
Ha ha ha.
I've already checked out your name...

I misjudged you guys.
I thought you were little snot-nosed punks.
...I know better now.

Oh, that rude comment was a slip of the tongue.
Now I feel like Monotoli should eat my shorts.

I kept asking around for Trout-flavored yogurt, but...

What?  You have a?
May I have it?
(Before you could answer, she took the &lt;.&gt;`)
Now I can make Trout-flavored yogurt for my guests.

*Wheeze, wheeze*...

Aren't you ...?
...I can't see too well...
Everything's blurry...  You are , aren't you?
It's me, we met in Twoson...  Everdred from Burglin Park.
You must remember.  I'm the best thief around.
That... Carpainter in Happy Happy Village was hiding something...
*wheeze, wheeze*... strange.
I stole it, and thought about selling it in the big city...
An old, city-wise man called it Mani Mani.
It's a strange-colored, doll-looking thing.
...Ohh... *wheeze*,  I'm in pain.
...and
.....
Monotoli tricked me and stole it... from me!
He tricked a thief!
He wanted me out of the way because I know his secret...
He gets his evil power from that statue!
...Listen!
I'll tell you only once.
At the cafe, check... behind... the counter...
...*Gasp*...
I said I'd tell you only once...
But if you insist, I'll tell you once more...
...*gasp, gasp*
Do do do you wanna hear it again? Yes No 
I've told you twice already...
But if you wanna hear one more time...
I'll tell you once more...
D... D... do... you wanna hear it again? Yes No 
I'm not that nice of a guy.  Besides.
I'm slipping away...
...Before I go, here's my last haiku poem:
When on your way out
Be sure that you say goodbye then lock the door tight.
This is my final request...  Don't follow me.
I must be on my way...
Whoa...
So... long!

There's a person lying on the ground.
I wonder if he's... he's...

He's not dead...
I thought he may have passed on.



Oooo... I don't like seeing a corpse around here.

He should really go to the hospital like other sick people do.



He's breathing...
Has he just been playing too hard?

Do you know him?
You must be a dangerous kid!
I'll bet you're on your way to Jackie's Cafe right now!



Don't cut in front of me!
If you give me somethin', I'll let you have my spot.
Will you give me somethin'? Yes No 
Then stay right there where you're too short to see a thing!

Don't you  feel better since you had the chance to talk with your friend?
I helped you find him.

All right, take my place.

So, what do I get?
Are you sure? Yes No 
If you don't want to give me somethin', don't say you're gonna give me somethin'...
All right, take my place.

Then stay right there where you're too short to see a thing!

Give me somethin' that makes me really happy!
And do it in a nice way!

All right, take my place.

If you don't want to give me somethin', don't say you're gonna give me somethin'...
All right, take my place.



Oh, no no no.  I don't want to go like that.
I'm glad it wasn't me.

Is that man going to... to...?



He doesn't look like a nice man.

He stared right at me...
Ooo... it was scary!





Okay!  You can get on the bus now...



What happened to those guys digging for the buried gold?
If they found the gold, it would be worth a huge amount of money.
They'd be able to pay off a million dollar debt very easily.
If I were them, I'd go to Japan and live it up!

I heard they couldn't find the buried gold.
Those guys worked really hard, but all they got was a diamond!



I wonder why the department store's closed.



When Monotoli became the owner, this department store began having strange happenings.



I heard the department store finally re-opened.
Hope they have a boffo sale.



Behind this wall, things seem very strange.
I feel like this isn't my place...
Maybe it's your place.



The boy stuck to the wall... may be a Peeping Tom.

Hello!
I heard you talking about trout-flavored yogurt.
I'm a maid who serves Mr. Monotoli, and I'm looking for trout-flavored yogurt to give to our special guest.
If you know anything about it, please tell me!
I've been searching and searching...

*Crash*
Ooops!
*Crunch*
Ooops!
...Greetings!  (It's Escargo Express's neglected class.)
Whew!  I just got here from the Dusty Dune desert.
There was this sunbathing guy, and he told me about a cave with lots of monkeys... or was it orangutans?
Anyway, he said... well... uh... I forgot.
Yep, I forgot... actually I forgot the stuff I was supposed to deliver, too.
I think it was some weird machine to make trout-flavored yogurt.
Yeah, I forgot it at the desert...
I'm not going back that way, so don't ask me to get the package...
I mean, it's your package, right?
So YOU go get it!
Go on, get out of here.
Maybe that thing I forgot is important to you...
So... have a good time in the desert!...



I'm very punctual about time and careful with money.
I don't look like it, though.





( checked the bus schedule.
It looks like the next bus will come soon.)  




75 dollars per night for a single room.

You finally got here.
This is the fifth  location.  But it's mine now.
Take it from me, if you dare...



Didactically speaking, seminal evidence seems to explicate the fact that your repudiation of entropy supports my theory of space-time synthesis.
Of this, I am irrefutably confident.



Mmmmm.
I think it's a very complicated issue.
..... Oh, sorry!
I was sleeping...



You guys can't envision the final collapse of capitalism?
Incredible!



You know, I really want to eat some Magic cake.
It's a mysterious work of art...  I can't get that cake off my mind.
There's only one woman who can make Magic cake...
She's hanging out in this club.
Yeah, she's over there at the entrance...
Anyway, the absolute irony and study of self-identification is...
Blah, blah, blah...
I don't know what to do!

The woman who sells magic cake seems to have been removed from the members list.



You don't understand what the hey everyone is talking about, do you?
I don't either, but I try to be patient with the customers.
They pay high prices just for a glass of water and the chance to have serious, intellectual discussions.
Actually, it's an easy business.
You want a drink?
We only serve water, though...



The show?  It's already started.
Everyone stares at the stone on stage and philosophizes.
...Doesn't it sound stupid?

If you just want water, go to the drug store.  It's a lot cheaper there.



I've finally awakened the inner me, the true self.
The patrons of this club are able to stare into their own soul hard enough to burn a hole in their psyche.
I'm now comfortable enough to stare at the real me, the true self, and burn the impression into my super-ego.
I want to be in this comfort zone at any time, all the time or at no time.
My id is telling me...

What?  What?  Magic Cake?
You came all this way just to eat my Magic Cake? Yes No 
Okay then, don't get in my way while I search for the little girl within me...

I see... okay...
Why don't you stop by a little cart out on the beach later?

Okay then,  don't get in my way while I search for the little girl within me...



Across the sea, there's a town called Scaraba.
It's a mysterious town.  It's my dream town.



I'm a grave robber.
I was scared of the pyramid in Scaraba... so, I didn't go in... but I tell people that I saw mummy-type monsters with my very own eyes!



Do you know the Stoic Club, in Summers?
You need to call a secret number for a reservation if you want to get in.
What?
Yeah, I'll give you the secret number.
I warn you though, it's a strange place...

I think this is a nice town.  Come back when you grow up!



If you come closer, I'll play the trumpet!
.....
Uhhh, I don't know how to play yet.



Bow...
...now brown cow?







There's a big monster living in the sea between here and Scaraba.
I've seen a picture of it.



How annoying!  Why are you are wandering around?
Summers is a posh resort, made for adults.

That Kung Fu-like hairstyle!  You look so cool!
I may fall in love with you.  Do you think I'm too forward?

How annoying!  Why are you are wandering around?
Summers is a posh resort, made for adults.



Don't get too excited about this town.  It's a tourist trap.
Everyone seems to be nice, but they're just doing it for the money.
I know from experience.



Excuse me.



I heard the security guard in the Scaraba Cultural Museum isn't very nice.
But he can be helpful.

Forget about the adventure, come back again!






Today to be the same as yesterday&gt;



Today's Daily Summers says...
Ooo la la, I brought the wrong paper by mistake.  It is the Summer Inquirerer
Listen to this headline...

...I really do not think so...




... This is big news here.


New gourmet dish makes big waves at the beach&gt;

There's a great advertisement in this morning's Daily Summers

Forget about solving mysteries and completing stages!
Welcome to the easy life in Summers!&gt;


Today will be the same as yesterday&gt;

Ah, sir... Are you already on your way to the beach?

Here is this morning's headlines from the Daily Summers...



Welcome to  L'hotel de Summers.
My name is  Risosha Richmonde, and I am the assistant manager.
I'm sorry , but I'm afraid  that we do not have any reservation under your name.
However, we can offer you a room at $ a night.
Would you be interested in a room?
That's too bad, .
Please keep us in mind the next time you come here on your holiday.

Did you have a relaxing sleep?
The sound of the ocean waves didn't disturb you, I trust.

Excellent choice, !
We hope you enjoy our wonderful ocean view.

That's too bad, .
Please keep us in mind the next time you come here on your holiday.

If you do not have enough cash with you, please feel free to use the ATM just over there.



Thank you again, Poke...
Uhhh,  .
Mr.
Miss.



I can't believe you pronounce Hotel as 
In this country, Hotel is pronounced 
...What?
So then in your country, is otter pronounced as ?
'Ow should I know these things?





Please... we do not have such trash on our menu.



Hey, talking to people at another table in a restaurant is like... breaking into their room and checking their drawers for valuables.
Yeah, other people on important adventures do such things, but you have to admit that it's bizarre!



I like the atmosphere in this restaurant.  They have good food, too.



I'll have the Braised Boa Over Minced Baby Leeks...
Oh, you're not the waiter.



I have fake teeth, so I like soft foods.
Not like rocks or stones.  They're too hard.



Pooooweeeet!  Oooo... sorry...
Y'know, I can't quite describe it...
Drinking glass after glass of ice coffee is... well...
Buuuurp!  Oooo... 'scuse me...



Right now, part of the Scaraba Cultural Museum is being remodeled.
Do you still want to enter? Yes No 
Since the Hieroglyph display is closed, people haven't wanted to visit.

Since the

Three dollars per person.
Study hard.Yes No 

Since the

You don't have any money, right?
Okay, since you kids look like you would study hard, you may enter, free of charge!
Oh wait... I can't do that!  Good bye.



Hello!
Is this Mr. Fork of the Scaraba Cultural Museum?...
It doesn't sound like you...
Well, I'll quickly tell you my story, 'cause I'm busy, busy, busy!
I found something so extraordinary that mere words could not do it justice.
What do you mean  ?
Don't you recognize my voice?
It's me, Mr. Spoon from the Fourside Museum of Natural History!
Look Mr. Fork, I'm not exaggerating this find!
I'm telling you...
It's fantastic!.....
It's outrageous!...
*Click*  Beeeeep



...mumble, mumble...
Why would Mr. Spoon from the Fourside museum try to call me?
I bet he just wants to brag about something...
Well, let him try...  I wonder what he wants to tell me?
Bah!  I dare him to try and upstage me...
Oh!  Pardon me...  I was just talking to myself... *cough*

You have a good reputation.
Wouldn't you like to focus your hard working energy in the exciting field of archaeology?

It must be something teeny weeny that Mr. Spoon has found.
I don't need to know the specifics.



I saw a chubby kid about your age here.
He looked like he was awfully wealthy.  He was being extravagant!

It's nice seeing you in such good shape.
I wonder what porky Pokey's doing.
Yeah, that's the boy I met before.



This room is being remodeled, so I can't show it to you...
I can't... well, I usually don't... show this room...
Once you hit adulthood, you'll understand.
I do, however, like jewelry.
Perhaps a little, shall we say,  would be in order...

Oh, the samurai kid is here.
Will  be giving me that gem? Yes No 
Excuse me?
So, what  just handed me is not a gem.
Hah ha ha.
I'm going to really enjoy the  that I just got.
Let's pretend this conversation never took place...
While I'm pretending, you go on in...

I can't... well, I usually don't... show this room...

You're such a good student.
I'm impressed by your passion for learning.  Come in.

Excuse me?
So, what  just handed me is not a gem.
Hah ha ha.

Let's pretend this conversation never took place...
While I'm pretending, you go on in... you





Excellent!
Do you feel like you're really experiencing this great historical period?
The experience is more valuable than a small gem...  Ha ha ha!
The other day, a rich kid came to Summers by helicopter...
He also took a picture of the Hieroglyphs.
I got lots of money from him.  Heh heh heh.

Here's a picture of the hieroglyphs, just for you.
It's a reward for studying so hard.
Use it in your Human Civilization class.  Ha ha ha!

Oh, you can't carry it 'cause you have too much stuff.
It's a pity.  You're such a hard worker.
Ha ha ha!













My cousin is a nurse in Twoson.
She's not good at administering shots.
The one she gave me was painful.



Wake up in the morning, fall in love.
Eat lunch, fall in love...
And at night, fall in love again...
That's my dream life.



The guy next to me is really bugging me.  He keeps following me around.



I wonder why such serious looking kids as you would come to this resort town...
You guys are spoiling the atmosphere...



I'm actually a surfer.  But you can't surf at this beach.
Should I become a porter so that I can get tips from all the old folks?



Are you from Eagleland?
If you like adventure, this isn't your kind of place.
You should travel across the sea to Scaraba from Toto, the port town.



Don't talk to me.
My mind is a complete blank.

Asian boy, you're so cool...
Don't look at me like that...

Don't talk to me.
My mind is a complete blank.



You look so serious...
You're in Summers, a dream paradise.
Relax, and have some fun.



The sky's blue and the sun is high.
The prices here are so high, it'll make your face turn blue!
That's Summers!



If you're bored, go check out the

They have a hieroglyph from a pyramid.



Another nice day.
Summers always has sunny days.





(It's a Myna bird!)

To go to Scaraba, you need to cross the sea.
However a monster named Kraken lives in the open sea.
He attacks ships that pass through.
Are you scared?

I'm a mighty sailor man
A mountain man I'm not
The open sea is home for me
And mountains aren't worth snot
...I'm writing a song for sailors.



Dinosaurs existed!  I saw one!
It had been out of the underground when it dried out.
Of course, it was dead!
Believe what I'm saying!



Would you like a boat ride? Yes No 
Ok, I understand.

Compared to
 the olden days, this boat ride is like being on a luxury liner.
Do you want another ride?
I'll give you a ride if you want, since you destroyed the Kraken.
Fsst Fsst.

Thank you!  You made my wife wake up.
She quit talking about all that serious crap...
Yeah!  Let's work hard!
If you're courageous, get on this boat.
You'll probably see the Kraken and experience getting seasick!
After all, it could only cost you your life, and you got that for free!
Luck will determine the outcome of this voyage.
So, do you want to sail the seas to Scaraba?
Twenty bucks per person is fine with me.Yes No 
I understand.
Stay here and shiver in fear for your future!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Do you wanna hear the same story again? Yes No

I don't feel like sending a ship out.
I'm worried about my wife...
I'm not afraid of the Kraken!
.....
My wife's totally ignoring her Magic cake business.
These days she spends her time hanging out in a strange club.
We no longer have any mutual interests to discuss.
Is our relationship over?

What?  You have no money?!
Come back after you make some money.

H... h... here it coooomes!
Oh, man!
I thought you guys were just everyday little kids, but you defeated the Kraken!
I also helped in the battle...
I threw my slippers at the beast...  Maybe you didn't notice.

WAAAAIT!  Wait!  Wait...
I need to stop the boat.
It's been a long time since I was out on the open sea, so I feel seasick...
Oh, man, what am I going to do?  A sailor who gets seasick?
So how come you guys are all right?
So... that bald guy over there... your buddy, right?...  He came from Dalaam?
You guys must be quite the adventurers!
Aren't there times when you'd just like to go back home?
So, you're not some mama's boy...
Well, it wouldn't hurt you to go back and visit once in a while.
Hey, that's an awfully strange carrot.  What kind of bunny would eat that?
Hahaha!  I'm feeling much better now!
Anchors aweigh!

I don't know who told you.
You came from far off just to eat my Magic cake?...
I thought making cakes would be the best career for me.

I used all leftover materials.  This is a very special Magic cake!

I can't make anymore Magic cakes.
If you want to try something tastier...
I have a &lt;.&gt;
Try it.
...I could make one extra good today.

( had a  dream, it was a very clear, and very strange, dream.)
Prince , the time  has now come for you to undertake your final trial.
Go to the  and endure this final test.
I am praying for your success in this final stage of your training.

You seem to have too much stuff to carry.
Come back after you get rid of something.



I'm just trying to take a nap in the shade.  Don't bother me!





(East of here is the port town of Toto)
...No, no...  I'm not a billboard...



Hey, hey!!
Stop putting your grimy fingerprints all over my car, you little punk!




150 dollars per night for a single room.



I won't say anything.
Go to  the place of emptiness again.

As I thought, the prophecy foretold of our only chance for success.
Please enjoy the life ahead of you as a regular boy.

Your future
 battle will be considerably more dangerous than you expect.
Don't be careless...

I am proud.
You have completed your Mu training.
There is nothing more to teach you from the holy writings.
Prince ,
I shall relay a message to you from Eternity.
The evil entity that controls all wickedness is preparing for the greatest struggle of all time...
The only ones who can challenge the entity are three boys and one girl.
One named  is the leader of the four.
One of the boys is you, Prince .
Now that you've completed your training, search out  at once.
For all beings, for the earth herself...
I pray for growth in the might of the four.

Go quickly!
         
 joined you.

My name is .  I am the one who will fight beside you.
I am the servant of .  I will obey .
!  My life is in your hands.

.....
I just communicated  with 's soul.  Do not mind me...



Use the treasures of Dalaam as you wish.
Go in peace.

We understand that you've experienced hardship in the past.
No one could fight the evil entity, except you.
We are proud.  We are happy.

Didn't you meet up with many monsters along the way?
Recently, several bad incidents occurred in this peaceful country...

Well, you should turn the power OFF instead of just pressing RESET.
All right? her



You're here!
We have little, but stay and rest for a while.
But I'm impressed!  You did so well for one who hasn't had much training.



Prince .
You're my favorite.  (blush)  tee hee hee.

Prince  has returned, so everyone is extremely happy.
Please stay and relax.

Since you left for a foreign country, the girls of Dalaam have had to endure their loneliness without you.

Prince .
You're my favorite.  (blush)  tee hee hee.

Prince .
You're my favorite.  (blush)  tee hee hee.



Please come in.
Look around the house as much as you want.



I just roasted some garlic and ate it, so the room still stinks.

I didn't eat any garlic today, so the room doesn't stink.



You know that you do do everything well, right?
Do do?  Ooops.
Say, Prince , are you still popular with the girls? Yes No 
You've been acting very serious lately.

Hello.
Congratulations.
Thank you...
...Oh, my foreign language skills worked!

We have difficulty communicating with foreigners.

I heard you're living a more serious lifestyle these days.

You've been acting very serious lately.





I wish I could recover my PP just by drinking water...
Even though I have never seen him before, I heard that the prince can do that.
I guess I need more training...
By the way, just what is PP anyway?...



..... preeet!...  pooooot!...



What is immortality.....?
Is it everlasting life?
Mmmmm Mmmmm.

I'm a little embarrassed to say it, but I'll tell you anyway...
I thought  was the study of stones.
I now realize it's about studying all night...
...What?  It's not?

What's the difference between  and 
.....Nothing?
Mmmmm Mmmmm



I heard that Prince  is deeply into 
...I want to help him, if I can.

I wonder if Prince  succeeded in ?
I wanted him to come by and show me his best barnyard impression.



You have nice eyes.
...You must be Prince .
Long ago, I completed Mu Training.
I want to show you a higher level of intelligence...
However, I'm still realizing and learning this high level...
I'll see you again.  So long!



Oh!  Prince !  I'm surprised you're not in training!
It seems like that's all you do these days.
Why don't you take some time to play with me?  I'm so lonely without you...

Prince  has good relationships with foreigners.
...What an international person!



Oh, Prince .
Do you have time to play with me? Yes No 
Hah, I knew it.   changed you!
I'm jealous of your !

Prince  is so cool, but you're also young and tough.

There are  so many monsters around recently, we can't relax and have fun.
(weep)

Happy me!
(patty cake, patty cake...)

Hah, I knew it.   changed you!
I'm jealous of your !



Prince ... (blush).
You are such a hunk.

I'm waiting for Prince  to see me and say 



(As strange as this may sound, there are statues of rabbits blocking your way.)



(How strange!  The rabbits and carrots disappeared all at once!)

That won't move the rabbits.

Welcome to the 
Our rooms range in price  from  $ to $  a night.
Right now, though, we only have our super deluxe suite available.
Would you like to stay?
We are very sorry that we do not have any of our less expensive rooms available at this time.

Good morning!
This sure is some nice weather we're having in Scaraba lately.

Please let us know if you find any scorpions...
It's very unlikely that they will come out, but you never can tell...

We are very sorry that we do not have any of our less expensive rooms available at this time.

Good morning, good sir!
Please allow me to read to you from the local newspaper, the Scaraba Papyrus...

...Well ...there is some news here about...



No, I don't want any mummy bandages!
No soliciting allowed please!



I've never seen you around here.
What do you want?  I do not have anything you would want.









Did you come from Toto by ship?
There's a scary monster in the sea...
...Did you beat him?  Or did you escape?
Either way, you are fantastic!



Snakes are so unpleasant, but so cute...
Oh, I don't know what I may be saying.



Should I keep a snake at home?
Perhaps I should  an expert.



Poisonous snakes cost more.
Why would a fine young  like you need one? man lady

Please, it is a very useful item!
Shall you buy one?  I am humbly offering it to you...Yes No 
You are afraid of snakes, are you not?  Heh heh heh.

That is 290 dollars, kind .Yes No 
I'll give you a discount as the sack has a hole in it.

However, I may be wrong, and if so... a thousand pardons.

Oh!
You have the mark of bad luck on your face...
Yet, I could be wrong, as you didn't wash your face lately.



(The door of the pyramid is firmly sealed...)



The Tenda tribe used to live here.
They went to the back of the Deep Darkness as they were too innocent.
I wonder if they are still alive.



If you're going to the Pyramid, prepare well, and be ready for whatever may occur.







I'm doing this as a hobby.  Isn't it cool?
I recently made a friend.  He used to be a Dungeon Maker.
And now he's a 
Would you like to meet him? Yes No 
I understand, he is a very strange fellow.

I stayed here the whole time you were gone.
But now I don't know why I did.

All righty then, I'll give you the key so that you can enter him.
Oh no... I don't have it!
I must have lost it somewhere.
I'm sorry, I don't worry about small things.

I understand, he is a very strange fellow.



I am not sure if it was the  but... there is a strange looking tower to the northwest.

You may enter.)

A scary place called Deep Darkness is on the other side of the river.
The monsters are very strong and you can lose your health just by wandering in the swamp.
Do you want to cross the river, even though you know it's a stupid idea? Yes No 
It was stupid of me to ask.
Let's watch the sunset over Deep Darkness together from here.

You returned from exploring the Deep Darkness?
I cannot believe you made it back alive.

The swamp is bottomless.
Even if you're swimming, you'll be dragged in.
It is a different story if you have a submarine.

I was born in this dark, creepy area.
I live, grow up... and die here.
That's my entire life as a monkey!...



The monkeys run the inn in the forest.  You can stay here for free!
Do you want to spend the night?

This is the Deep Darkness.
When you walk through the swamp, you endanger your health.
You can't help it.  That's why it's called Deep Darkness.

If I become a pig, I can find the mushrooms called Magic truffles.

Hi!  How are you today?  Oh, you're not feeling well?  Be healthy!



Good evening.
I'm a talking rock.
But the rocks around here don't talk too much.
The rock that talks the most is deep down in the labyrinth a ways ahead... in the 
Don't forget to talk to the rock!  It's important!



There's only one Tenda who's not shy.
It's me, bubby!
You know what?
There's something scary that comes from the underground.
So, we covered up the hole.
There are lots of dinosaurs there.
I went there once, but I came right back, 'cause I was so surprised!
There was a talking stone that talks a lot.
Do you wanna go and see?
I understand.
But I'm not as strong as I look.
I'm sorry, I guess I can't help you.
The guy next to me is strong, but he lacks conversation skills.
He needs to overcome his shyness first.

Recently, everyone is able to talk a lot, so I've lost my identity.

Oh, I wanna talk...



(Hot Springs.  Good all over)



Kidnapped.  I was.  Boing!
Kidnapper.  Bad guy.
Bad guy gone.  Zoom!
Where?  To the past.
Ding, ding!



This is very hard for me to tell you, but...



In order to defeat Giygas, who is attacking from the past, you must warp to the past.
This can be done by way of the 
However, the machine cannot warp living things, I mean lifeforms.
Life is demolished in the process of warping.
The only way to accomplish the time travel is to transfer your brain  into a robot, and send the robot to the past.
...The transfer means that your spirit will go with the robot while your body is left behind...
I cannot promise that your spirit will come back after the battle in the past.
Yet, you must understand that the four of you are the chosen ones.
Do you still wish to face Giygas by traveling to the past? Yes  No 
Yes, it's natural to feel as you do.
The only thing left is the destruction of our planet...

...Hmmm ...you accept this while knowing that you may not be able to return to your current form, right? Yes  No 
...Yes... I see...  You have really set your mind on this...

Even though I listened to the talkative Mystery Rock's story,
I don't understand what he's talking about.

The rock suddenly stopped talking.
In other words... it's not saying anything.



What are you doing in the dinosaur's cage?
I'll open the door for you, and you get out of the cage quick.
That's an order from the boss.  ...By the way, thanks for the .
('s  was taken.)
(That nasty smell left you at the same time!)

A rock that doesn't talk is no fun at all.

Why don't you see the talkative mystery rock.
That rock really jabbers away!!



We are the same Tenda as those above ground.
...We seem different?
Yeah, you know, the Tenda up there are shy and don't like to talk.

It may be  my imagination, but I think I hear the sound of other Tenda talking up  above.
I wonder... have they overcome their shyness?



Didn't you think that the Tenda up above have some particularly beautiful women?
They're still shy, though.

Tenda women
 up above ground are pretty, but the men seem kind of run down.



You're strange, but you smell good.  So I'll tell you a secret.
Did you feel the earthquake a little while ago?
...You know, we have earthquakes all the time here.
After an earthquake, the hot springs will erupt.
The blue springs are great for recovering health.
The Red springs are perfect for healing paralysis or drawing out poison.

Hey! Strange fellow.
After an earthquake, the hot springs erupt out of the ground.
Have you ever noticed that?
The blue springs are great for recovering health.
The red springs are perfect for healing paralysis or drawing out poison.



Tenda who like to talk came to the Lost Underworld because we couldn't stand the quiet up above.
So, we established a separate tribe.
I hope we can be friendly again some day.
...Yeah, it was a lot easier to live up above.

You guys  helped the upper tribe and the lower tribe gain unity again.
Soon, we'll be one village again!  Thank you.



We made a cage for dinosaurs and locked them up...
That's what my brother tells me.
But I don't believe it...  He's just spewing out of his cake hole.



A chubby, obnoxious kid from some foreign country said something heartrending...
So, I'm healing my wounds in the hot springs.

Finally, you talk to me.
Listen .
I'm going to tell you something very important.
You may want to take notes.
Ready?
You're the chosen one.
Your destiny is not only yours...
It's the destiny of the whole universe.
There will be a time in which all of you in the universe will overlap each other.
...It's not necessary to understand now.
Do you remember  in Onett?
That is one of 
It is a spot which gives you power and allows you to realize all your skills.
There was a monster that protected it.
The monster was influenced by the power of the place.
You must have beaten those monsters.
You must reach all of the eight power spots in the world...
When the Sound Stone records the melodies of all eight power spots, you can finally see 
I'll tell you all of the power spots.
1.  in Onett.
2.  in Peaceful Rest Valley near Twoson.
3.  in Grapefruit Falls in Saturn Valley.
4.  found by  in Winters.
5.  at the edge of the city of Fourside.
6.  which  knows.
7. and...  where the shining lichen lives in the cave.
8. A new place is now going to be opened up to you.
 located southwest of here.
Listen to the melodies of all eight power spots.
If you do not fail, you may upset Giygas' plans...
Understand, ?
The time will come.
The time when the destiny of you and the whole universe will overlap...
It is fast approaching.

I don't need words anymore.
I'll turn back into a simple rock.

I'll tell you all of the power spots.

The bird right there says strange words like  and 



Here, the dinosaurs don't come and attack me.  So, I can relax.
...Except now I can't get out.

Without  dinosaurs, this place seems like it is missing something big.



Ring, ring, rrriiing!!



Thank you for coming all the way into this primitive country.
You must be tired.  To stay,  it'll run you $.
You are going to stay, aren't you?

I'm sorry, there's really not much to say...

I am your courage.
I follow you here in Magicant.

Let's say Flying Man.

Of course, we're your courage.
But we warned you not to treat us like trash!
Didn't you get it?!
This isn't courage, it's desperation.
If you don't understand  look it up in the dictionary.
Okay?
My name's The Final Flying Man.

I'm also your courage.
Call me Return of the Flying Man!
...How's that?
However... don't treat us like trash.

I'm Flying Man 3.
Your courage hasn't died yet.

The Sea of Eden is filled with ultimate intelligence.
You can't go there unless you're truly ready.
It's a place where you can touch the truth of the universe.
Going there may bring sorrow.



, you've stood on the eight power spots of the earth.
From these, you created Magicant, the realm of your mind.
In Magicant, there's beauty, kindness, sorrow, and hatred.
Of course, there's an evil and violent side of you.
The Sea of Eden sits at the center of those feelings.
It takes you to the truth about yourself.



Oh , are you tired from traveling on your adventure? Yes No 
Yeah, that's right.
You can't even think about being tired at a time like this.
Be strong!

If you wish, you can stay here forever.
I'll make some  for you.

Yeah, that's right.
You can't even think about being tired at a time like this.

Good luck, !

Giygas' goal is  to destroy you.
Listen carefully!
Everything in the unverse could be destroyed at the hands of Giygas.
But he and his followers are also in trouble.
The Apple of Enlightenment has foretold that Giygas' attempt will fail.
It is because of the existence of a boy named .
